This is the ledger filetype for vim.
Copy each file to the corresponding directory in your ~/.vim directory.
Then include the following line in your .vimrc  or in ~/.vim/filetype.vim
  au BufNewFile,BufRead *.ldg,*.ledger setf ledger | comp ledger
You can also use a modeline like this in every ledger file
  vim:filetype=ledger

Configuration
======================================================================
Include the following let-statements somewhere in your .vimrc
to modify the behaviour of the ledger filetype.

* Number of colums that will be used to display the foldtext.
  Set this when you think that the amount is too far off to the right.
    let g:ledger_maxwidth = 80

* String that will be used to fill the space between account name
  and amount in the foldtext. Set this to get some kind of lines
  or visual aid.
    let g:ledger_fillstring = '    -'
  My special tip is to use so-called digraphs:
  Press <C-K> followed by the two-characters key sequence below.
  (in insert-mode)
    '. = ˙ or ': = ¨ --> ˙˙˙˙˙˙ or ¨¨¨¨¨¨
    ', = ¸           --> ¸¸¸¸¸¸
    .M = ·           --> ······
    >> = »           --> »»»»»»
  All those look rather unobstrusive
  and provide a good visual aid to find the correct amount.

* If you want the account completion to be sorted by level of detail/depth
  instead of alphabetical, include the following line:
    let g:ledger_detailed_first = 1

Completion
======================================================================
Omni completion is implemented for account names and tags.

Accounts
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Account names are matched by the start of every sub-level.
When you insert an account name like this:
  Asse<C-X><C-O>
You will get a list of top-level accounts that start like this.

Go ahead and try something like:
  As:Ban:Che<C-X><C-O>
When you have an account like this, 'Assets:Bank:Checking' should show up.

When you want to complete on a virtual transaction,
it's currently best to keep the cursor in front of the closing bracket.
Of course you can insert the closing bracket after calling the completion, too.

Tags
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The support for completing tags is pretty basic right now
but it's useful to keep the spelling of your tags consistent.
You can call the completion after the ';' to get a list of all tags.
When you have a list of tags (:like: :this:) you can call
the completion too and everything up to the last ':' (excluding whitespace)
will be considered the beginning of the tag to search for.
