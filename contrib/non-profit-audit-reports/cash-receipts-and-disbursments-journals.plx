#
#    Script to generate a cash receipts and disbursement joural reports
#    using Ledger.
#
#    Accountants sometimes ask for a report called the "cash receipts and
#    disbursements journals".  From a programmer's perspective, these are two
#    reports that have the following properties:
#
#       * Receipts: "a list of all transactions in the period where funds
#                    enter a cash account (i.e., the amount reconciled
#                    against the cash account is > 0"
#
#       * Disbursements: "a list of all transactions in the period where
#                         funds leave a cash account (i.e., the amount
#                         reconciled against the cash account is < 0)
