** DONE [#B] -e doesn't seem to work for providing an end date
  - State "DONE"       [2008-04-04 Fri 14:34] \\
    There was a problem with the -e date parsing.  I now interpret "-e june"
    to mean that you want the report to end AT June, rather than IN June.

  The release (2.6.0.90) doesn't seem to properly parse dates.  The svn
  version (rev. 1048) works fine for full dates (yyyy/mm/dd) with the -b -e
  params but nothing else works.  For example in the following only the last
  one works:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -f my.ledger -b mar -e apr print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 03/01 -e -04/01 apr print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 03/01 -e 04/01 print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 08/03/01 -e 08/04/01 print
ledger -f my.ledger -b 2008/03/01 -e 2008/04/01 print
  :END:
  The -p param doesn't seem to work at all.

** DONE [#C] Entry command doesn't match debit account when description is unmatched
  - State "DONE"       [2008-07-20 Sun 20:32]
  I think I've isolated a bug with the entry command where I get "Equity"
  instead of a valid debit account:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger entry 2008/07/18 "Pei Wei" food 20 checking

2008/07/18 Pei Wei
    Expenses:Food:Out                        $ 20.00
    Assets:Checking

$ ledger entry 2008/07/18 "Foo Bar" food 20 checking

2008/07/18 Foo Bar
    Expenses:Food                            $ 20.00
    Equity
  :END:

  The first command proves that ledger understands I have an `Assets:Checking`
  account.  That's because I already have entries for `Pei Wei`.

  If I enter a description that doesn't match a previous entry, it doesn't
  match `checking` to `Assets:Checking`.

    This is a known bug that was fixed in 2.6.  If you need a back-patch for
    2.4.1, please let me know.
  We have ledger-2.4 in the ports, but it segfaults on freebsd-8 (the current
  dev version of the OS).  The backtrace is incoherent, because the libs are
  stripped and we have no symbols.  Anyway, a sane person would want a more
  recent ledger.  The tarball exhibits the exact same problem as the one from
  SVN:

  I know C and i can do some gdb(1), but i don't have the C++ knowledge to
  even fix this one.  It looks not all that complicated.  Maybe a little patch
  could help the C++ compiler to figure out the type inference.

  I used emacs for quite some time, but got annoyed with its ancient lisp.  So
  using the common lisp version is currently not an option for me, and without
  emacs one has to type way to much for some little reports.  Could you please
  bring the C++ version into a usable state again?  perhaps it's not that much
  work?

    The cents disappeared because 'D $1,000.00' must be specified at the beginning

    The extra penny crept in because of the way that commodity have "lot" details

    since that's what most people are likely to use, just as this example does.

** WORKSFORME [#A] Monthly register command displays nothing
  - State "WORKSFORME" [2008-07-17 Thu 20:12] \\
    This has apparently been fixed by the recent date/time bug fixes.
  The command is:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -p 2005 -e 2005/08/17 --monthly reg
  :END:
  This is against my own ledger file.

** WORKSFORME [#B] Problems with the prices.db file
  - State "WORKSFORME" [2008-07-17 Thu 21:45] \\
    Pricing entries must start with a capital P, not a lowercase p.

    This bug also mentions other issues, which are now contained in another
    bug.
  - State "TODO"       [2008-04-05 Sat 20:06] \\
    However, even though I do not receive parse errors any longer, the
    price-db command does not work the way I expect it to. When I issue a
    'bal' option, ledger still outputs the values in their commodity rather
    than the dollar amount, so even though I am not receiving an error, it
    still does not seem to work for me.
  My prices.db file looks like: 
  :DATA:
p 2007/01/14 02:18:01 WMCVX $5.04 
p 2007/01/14 02:18:02 WMICX $6.65
  :END:
  Notice there is no carriage return after the second line and that the file
  begins on line 1.
  
  When I run 'ledger --price-db prices.db bal' I get the following: 
  :OUTPUT:
Error: prices.db, line 2: Failed to parse dateP 
Error: Errors parsing file 'life/finances/ledger/prices.db' 
  :END:

  If I have a carriage return on the second line, I get errors for both line 2
  and line 3. If i have one entry on a single line, I get an error for line 2.
  
  Any ideas? 
  
  Also, I would like to get the prices.db perl script working to automatically
  grab the values from Fidelity, but I have not been able to do anything
  beyond installing the appropriate perl modules. If there are any
  instructions for this usage, I would appreciate it.

** DUPLICATE [#A] Bug with date ranges

    This has been fixed, see the comments in #36.
  I'm using the latest source from CVS and it appears the `-e` option is
  broken.  For example this works as expected:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -b 2006/05/01 bal
  :END:

But this does not.  No output whatsoever:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -b 2006/05/01 -e 2006/05/31 bal
  :END:

This also doesn't work.  It just shows `Opening Balances: 0`:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -p "last month" bal

  Here is what is in the prices.db file:

P 2007/03/04 00:00:00 gouda 7 USD 
  :END:
  So you multiply 4*2.75 and add 7, you get 18.  Since the units are USD, what
  is the beef?  Why isn't ledger seeing 1 gouda and 4 halfg as 18 USD?

** DUPLICATE [#B] Reconciling doesn't work in ledger.el			 :EMACS:
   - State "DUPLICATE"  [2008-07-16 Wed 03:56] \\
     Duplicated by #64.
   I've tried version 2.5 but have had some problems.

   I use Carbon Emacs on Mac OS X to edit my Ledger files.  Unfortunately the
   reconcile functionality doesn't work any more.  Pressing the space bar
   doesn't always toggle an entry, sometimes it needs to be pressed twice,
   sometimes it never goes.  Additionally, even if some entries are toggled,
   nothing is changed in the main file and pressing C-c C-c just re-sets the
   reconcile window back to it's original state.

   I've tried with and without the new ledger-clear-whole-entries variable set.
