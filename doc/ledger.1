.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command-line accounting tool based on the power and completeness
of double-entry accounting.  It is only a reporting tool, which means it never
modifies your data files, but it does offer a large selection of reports, and
different ways to customize them to your needs.
.Sh COMMANDS
.Nm
accepts several top-level commands, each of which generates a different
kind of basic report.  Most of them accept a
.Ar report-query
argument, in order to determine what should be reported.  To understand the
syntax of a
.Ar report-query ,
see the section on
.Sx QUERIES .
In its most basic form, simply specifying one or more strings produces a
report for all accounts containing those strings.
.Pp
If no command is given,
.Nm
enters a
.Tn REPL ,
or command loop, allowing several commands to be executed on the same
dataset without reparsing.
.Pp
The following is a complete list of accepted reporting commands:
.Bl -tag -width accounts
.It Ic accounts Oo Ar report-query Oc
List all accounts for postings that match the
.Ar report-query .
.El
.Bl -tag -width balance
.It Ic balance Oo Ar report-query Oc
Print a balance report showing totals for postings that match
.Ar report-query ,
and aggregate totals for parents of those accounts.  Options most commonly used
with this command are:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "--collapse (-n)"
.It Fl \-basis Pq Fl B
Report in terms of cost basis, not amount or value.  This is the only form of
report which is guaranteed to always balance to zero, when no
.Ar report-query
is specified.
Only show totals for the top-most accounts.
.It Fl \-empty Pq Fl E
Show accounts whose total is zero.
.It Fl \-flat
Rather than display a hierarchical tree, flatten the report to show subtotals
for only accounts matching
.Ar report-query .
.It Fl \-no-total
Suppress the summary total shown at the bottom of the report.
.El
.Pp
The synonyms
.Ic bal
and
.Ic b
are also accepted.
.It Ic budget Oo Ar report-query Oc
A special balance report which includes three extra columns: the amount
budgeted during the reporting period, how spending differed from the budget,
and the percentage of budget spent (exceeds 100% if you go over budget).
Note that budgeting requires one or more
.Do
periodic transactions
.Dc
to be defined in your data file(s).  See the manual for more information.
.It Ic cleared Oo Ar report-query Oc
A special balance report which adds two extra columns: the cleared balance for
each account, and the date of the most recent cleared posting in that account.
For this accounting to be meaningful, the cleared flag must be set on at least
one posting.  See the manual for more information.
.It Ic commodities Oo Ar report-query Oc
List all commodities for postings matching the
.Ar report-query .
.It Ic convert
Reads data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file and generates
.Nm
transactions.
.It Ic csv Oo Ar report-query Oc
Report of postings matching the
.Ar report-query
in CSV format (comma-separated values).  Useful for exporting data to a
spreadsheet for further analysis or charting.
.It Ic entry Oo Ar entry-template Oc
Generate and display a new, properly formatted
.Nm
transaction by comparing
the
.Ar entry-template
to the transactions in your data file(s).  For more information on draft
templates and using this command to quickly create new transactions, see the
section
.Sx ENTRIES .
.Pp
The synonym
.Ic xact
is also accepted.
.It Ic emacs Oo Ar query Oc
Output posting and transaction data in a format readily consumed by the Emacs
editor, in a series of Lisp forms.  This is used by the Emacs ledger-mode to
process reporting data from
.Nm .
.It Ic equity Oo Ar report-query Oc
Print a transaction with a series of postings that balance current totals for
accounts matching the
.Ar report-query
in a special account called
.Li Equity:Opening Balances .
The purpose of this report is to close the books for a prior year, while using
these equity postings to carry forward those balances.
.It Ic org
Produce a journal file suitable for use in the Emacs org mode.
.It Ic payees Oo Ar report-query Oc
List all payees for postings matching the
.Ar report-query .
.It Ic pricemap
Produce a file which can be used to generate a graph with graphviz showing
the relationship of commodities in the
.Nm
file.
.It Ic prices Oo Ar report-query Oc
Report prices for all commodities in postings matching the
.Ar report-query .
The prices are reported with the granularity of a single day.
.It Ic pricedb Oo Ar report-query Oc
Report prices for all commodities in postings matching the
.Ar report-query .
Prices are reported down to the second, using the same format as the
.Pa ~/.pricedb
file.
.It Ic print Oo Ar report-query Oc
Print out the full transactions of any matching postings using the same
format as they would appear in a data file.  This can be used to extract
subsets from a
.Nm
file to transfer to other files.
.It Ic push Oo Ar options Oc
In the
.Tn REPL ,
push a set of command-line
.Ar options ,
so that they will apply to all subsequent reports.
.It Ic pop
In the
.Tn REPL ,
pop any option settings that have been
.Sm off
.Ic push
ed.
.Sm on
.It Ic register Oo Ar report-query Oc
List all postings matching the
.Ar report-query .
This is one of the most common commands, and can be used to provide a variety
of useful reports.  Options most commonly used
with this command are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "--collapse (-n)"
.It Fl \-average Pq Fl A
Show the running average, rather than a running total.
.It Fl \-current Pq Fl c
Don't show postings beyond the present day.
.It Fl \-exchange Ar commodity Pq Fl X
Render all values in the given
.Ar commodity ,
if a price conversion rate can be determined.  Rates are always displayed
relative to the date of the posting they are calculated for.  This means a
.Ic register
report is a historical value report.  For current values, it may be preferable
to use the
.Ic balance
report.
.It Fl \-gain Pq Fl G
Show any gains (or losses) in commodity values over time.
.It Fl \-head Ar number
Only show the top
.Ar number
postings.
.It Fl \-historical Pq Fl H

.It Fl \-invert
Invert the value of amounts shown.
.It Fl \-market Pq Fl V
Show current market values for all amounts.  This is determined in a somewhat
magical fashion.  It is probably more straightforward to use
.Fl \-exchange
option.
.It Fl \-period Ar time-period Pq Fl p
Show postings only for the given
.Ar time-period .
.It Fl \-related Pq Fl r
Show postings that are related to those that would have been shown.  It has
the effect of displaying the
.Qq other side
of the postings.
.It Fl \-sort Ar value-expression Pq Fl S
Sort postings by evaluating the given
.Ar value-expression .
Note that a comma-separated list of expressions is allowed, in which case each
sorting term is used in order to determine the final ordering.  For example,
to search by date and then amount, one would use:
.Dl ledger reg --sort 'date, amount'
.It Fl \-tail Ar number
Only show the last
.Ar number
postings.
.It Fl \-uncleared Pq Fl U
Only show uncleared (i.e., recent) postings.

.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "--collapse (-n)"
.It Fl \-by-payee Pq Fl P
Group postings by common payee names.
.It Fl \-daily Pq Fl D
Group postings by day.
.It Fl \-weekly Pq Fl W

The synonyms
.Ic reg
and
.Ic r
are also accepted.
.It Ic server
This command requires that Python support be active.  If so, it starts up an
.Tn HTTP
server listening for requests on port 9000.  This provides an alternate
interface to creating and viewing reports.  Note that this is very much a
work-in-progress, and will not be fully functional until a later version.
.It Ic select Oo Ar sql-query Oc

.Nm
will return success
if no errors are found.
.It Ic stats Oo Ar report-query Oc

.It Fl \-subtotal Pq Fl s
Report register as a single subtotal.
.It Fl \-tail Ar INT
Report only the last
.Ar INT
entries.  Only useful on a register report.  Alias for
.Fl \-last Ar INT
.It Fl \-time-colon
Display the value for commodities based on seconds as hours and minutes.
Thus 8100s will be displayed as 2:15h instead of 2.25h.
.It Fl \-time-report
Add two columns to the
.Ic balance
report to show the earliest checkin and checkout times for timelog entries.
.It Fl \-total Ar EXPR Pq Fl T
Define a value expression used to calculate the total in reports.

Show only dates and totals to format the output for plots.
.It Fl \-total-width Ar INT
Set the width of the total field in the register report.
.It Fl \-trace Ar INT
Enable tracing.  The
.Ar INT
specifies the level of trace desired.
.It Fl \-truncate Ar STR
Indicates how truncation should happen when the contents of columns
exceed their width.  Valid arguments for
.Ar STR
are
.Ar leading ,
.Ar middle ,
and
.Ar trailing .
The default is smarter than any of these three,
as it considers sub-names within the account name (that style is
called
.Qq abbreviate ) .
.It Fl \-unbudgeted
Show only un-budgeted postings.
.It Fl \-uncleared Pq Fl U
Use only uncleared transactions in calculations and reports.
.It Fl \-unrealized
Show generated unrealized gain and loss accounts in the balance
report.
.It Fl \-unrealized-gains
Allow the user to specify what account name should be used for
unrealized gains.  Defaults to
.Sy "Equity:Unrealized Gains" .
Often set in one's
.Pa ~/.ledgerrc
file to change the default.
.It Fl \-unrealized-losses
Allow the user to specify what account name should be used for
unrealized losses.  Defaults to
.Sy "Equity:Unrealized Losses" .
Often set in one's
.Pa ~/.ledgerrc
file to change the default.
.It Fl \-unround
Perform all calculations without rounding and display results to full
precision.
.It Fl \-values
Show the values used by each tag when used in combination with the
.Ic tags
command.
.It Fl \-value-expr Ar EXPR
Set a global value expression annotation.
.It Fl \-verbose
Print detailed information on the execution of
.Nm .
.It Fl \-verify
Enable additional assertions during run-time.  This causes a significant
slowdown.  When combined with
.Fl \-debug Ar CODE
.Nm
will produce memory trace information.
.It Fl \-verify-memory
Verify that every constructed object is properly destructed.  This is for
debugging purposes only.
.It Fl \-version
Print version information and exit.
.It Fl \-weekly Pq Fl W
Shorthand for
.Fl \-period Ar weekly .
.It Fl \-wide Pq Fl w
Assume 132 columns instead of the TTY width.
.It Fl \-yearly Pq Fl Y
Shorthand for
.Fl \-period Ar yearly .
.El
.Sh PRE-COMMANDS
Pre-commands are useful when you aren't sure how a command or option
will work.  The difference between a pre-command and a regular command
is that pre-commands ignore the journal data file completely, nor is
the user's init file read.
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Ic args No / Ic query
Evaluate the given arguments and report how
.Nm
interprets it against the following model transaction:

by the GenerateTests harness for development testing.
.It Ic period
Evaluate the given period and report how
.Nm
interprets it.
.\".It Ic script
.It Ic template
Shows the insertion template that the
.Ic xact
command generates.  This is a debugging command.
.El
.Sh QUERIES
The syntax for reporting queries can get somewhat complex.  It is a series of
query terms with an implicit OR operator between them.  The following terms
are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width "term and term"
.It Ar regex
A bare string is taken as a regular expression matching the full account name.
Thus, to report the current balance for all assets and liabilities, you would
use:
.Pp
.Dl ledger bal asset liab
.It Ic payee Ar regex Pq Ic \&@ Ns Ar regex
Query on the payee, rather than the account.
.It Ic tag Ar regex Pq Ic \&% Ns Ar regex
.It Ic note Ar regex Pq Ic \&= Ns Ar regex
Query on anything found in an item's note.
.It Ic code Ar regex Pq Ic \&# Ns Ar regex
Query on the xact's optional code (which can be any string the user wishes).
.It Ar term Cm and Ar term
Query terms are joined by an implicit OR operator.  You can change this to AND
by using the
.Cm and
keyword.  For example, to show food expenditures occurring at
Shakee's Pizza, you could say:
.Pp
.Dl Li ledger reg food and @Shakee
.It Ar term Cm or Ar term
When you wish to be more explicit, use the OR operator.
.It Ic show
.It Cm not Ar term
Reverse the logical meaning of the following term.  This can be used with
parentheses to great effect:
.Pp
.Dl Li ledger reg food and @Shakee and not dining
.It \&( Ar term No \&)
If you wish to mix OR and AND operators, it is often helpful to surround
logical units with parentheses.  \fBNOTE\fR: Because of the way some shells
interpret parentheses, you should always escape them:
.Pp
.Dl Li ledger bal \e( assets or liab \e) and not food

.Sh DEBUG COMMANDS
In addition to the regular reporting commands,
.Nm
also accepts several
debug commands:
.Bl -tag -width balance
.It Ic args Oo Ar report-query Oc
Display complete analysis of how
.Nm
interpreted the given
.Ar report-query .
Useful if you want to understand how report queries are translated into value
expressions.
.It Ic eval Oo Ar value-expression Oc
Evaluate the given
.Ar value-expression
and prints the result.  For more on value expressions, see the section
.Sx EXPRESSIONS .
.It Ic format Oo Ar format-string Oc
Display an analysis of how
.Ar format-string
was parsed, and what it would look like applied to a sample transaction.  For
more on format strings, see the section
.Sx FORMATS .
.It Ic generate
Generate 50 randomly composed yet valid
.Nm
transactions.
.It Ic parse Oo Ar value-expression Oc
Parse the given
.Ar value-expression
and display an analysis of the expression tree and its evaluated value.  For
more on value expressions, see the section
.Sx EXPRESSIONS .
.It Ic python Oo Ar file Oc
Invoke a Python interpreter to read the given
.Ar file .
What is special about this is that the
.Nm
module is builtin, not read from
disk, so it doesn't require
.Nm
to be installed anywhere, or the shared

.It Ic reload
Reload all data files for the current session immediately.
Can only be used in the
.Tn REPL .
.It Ic template Oo Ar draft-template Oc
Display information about how
.Ar draft-template
was parsed.  See the section on

.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Every option to
.Nm
may be set using an environment variable if the option has a long name.
For example setting the environment variable
.Ev LEDGER_DATE_FORMAT="%d.%m.%Y'
will have the same effect as specifying
.Fl \-date-format Ar '%d.%m.%Y'
on the command-line.  Options on the command-line always take precedence over
environment variable settings, however.
