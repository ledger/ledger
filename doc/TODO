* TODO [#A] Forecasting fails to work
  John sent out an email about forecasting 2006/04/06, and I created a simple
  ledger with this content snipped from his email:
  :DATA:
~ Monthly from 2005/10/20 until 2007/01/01
  Expenses:Rent   $550
  Assets:Checking
  :END:
  Now I'm not sure what to do.
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger --budget -M -f forecasttest.dat reg Expenses
Error: Please specify ledger file using -f or LEDGER_FILE environment variable.
  :END:
  and more of the same.

  If I switch to a live file that has an analogous entry at the top and an
  otherwise working ledger, I get
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -s --forecast bal Expenses
Error: Unrecognized command 'Expenses'
  :END:

  If I enter the exact same command but without the "--forecast", I get a
  listing of current balances, as expected (a bit meaningless, of course,
  since it sums everything since I started this ledger).

  If I enter the same command but with forecast replaced by budget, I get the
  sum for health insurance to date that's one payment less than what I get if
  I drop the --budget.  FWIW, the date specifier in the budget / forecast
  entry is
  :DATA:
~ monthly from 2008/11/01 until 2009/06/01
  :END:
  I'm confused.

  What I /want/ to do is to enter, for example, forecasts of repeating
  expenses (e.g., phone bills) out into the future plus forecasts of isolated
  events (e.g., a tax payment or a projected bit of income) and have it show
  me my cash flows by month over time to some specified date in the future.
  (It'd be nice if I did it by day to see if I had a problem in some account.)

  Then, when that phone or tax bill becomes reality, I want it to start using
  the actuals, instead.  It'd be nice if it were smart enough to do it
  automatically, but I rather suspect I'll need to prompt it.

  Since moving to 2.6.1, I'm still having some old transactions which are
  showing extra pennies here and there. I've simplified my file to the
  following. Note that in my sell transaction, I'm using a format that someone
  mentioned on this list a long time ago which allows me to keep track of
  capital gains. Is this still the format I should be using?

  Downloaded and (eventually) compiled the latest version from anonymous CVS.

  Had to update my 'automake' to 1.9 and add "#include <cassert>" to
  datetime.h to get it to make.

  Runs the help screen OK but SEGV's out when attempting to do any useful

  System is debian stable ('sarge'), gcc 3.3.5 fully upgraded.

  "I don't yet have a good idea of why an individual transaction could need to

  I'll give you one from the other day.  My wife and I just prepaid into a
  local vegetable co-op that sustains us through the winter.  It cost $225 to
  join the program, so we wrote a check.  I didn't want our October grocery
  budget to be that much out of whack, however.  What I really wanted was for
  the money to be evenly distributed over the next six months so that our
  monthly budgets gradually take a hit for the vegetables we'll pick up from
  the co-op, even though we've already paid for them.
  
  These entries accomplish this.  Every month until April we'll start with an
  automatic $37.50 deficit like we should, while our checking account really
  knows that it debited $225 this month.

* TODO [#B] A few changes for the textual parser
  - Ignore any line like /^\s*;/ as a comment -even in the middle of a
    transaction
  - Treat -00.00 the same as hB300.00 : I found myself making this mistake
    frequently.
  - Print the out offending transaction and the 'out of balance' amount in the
    'unbalanced transaction' error message.
  - It would be nice if the 'entry' command could be modified to assume the
    amount is the same as last time if you dont supply it.  It also doesn't
    seem to reproduce multiple-split transactions either -- it seems you only
    get the first split line.

* TODO [#B] Budgeting oddness
  I am trying to understand the budgeting information in the ledger
  documentation, as well as to understand some basic syntax in my ledger file
  and why it does not appear to be working correctly.  If I have a ledger file
  with:
  :DATA:
~Monthly
   Exp:....   $1000.00
   Exp:....   $500.00
   Exp:....   $250.00
   Exp:....   $1000.00
   Assets
  :END:
  [with real categories blanked out, of course], and Assets at the end, what
  does this imply?  That expenses will be withdrawn/balanced against assets?
  What happens if I have no expenses recorded in my ledger, e.g., what is the
  intended behavior of the budgeting functionality?

  In addition, the following three entries seem to be causing somewhat odd
  behavior:
  :DATA:
2006/05/23
     Assets:Checking:xxxx             $1259.44
     Equity:Opening Balance

2006/05/23
     Assets:Savings:xxxx               $711.31
     Equity:Opening Balance

2006/05/23
     Expenses:Loans:xxxx               $750.00
     Assets:Checking:xxxx
  :END:

  When I perform:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -f ~/ledger.txt -MAs bal ^expenses
              $375.00  Expenses:Loans
              $750.00    xxxx
--------------------
              $375.00
  :END:
  and these are the only three entries in the ledger file, did I miss
  something as far as the intended behavior?  Is there a bug somewhere in my
  libgmp, etc?

* TODO [#B] Bug in ledger equity output
  Seeing as how I've reached the end of my financial year my thoughts turned
  to how to 'close the books'.

  I have the following as part of my account tree:
  :DATA:
Assets:Super:ARF
Assets:Super:CSS
Assets:Super:CSS:Contributions
  :END:

  The ledger 'balance' report correctly shows `Contributions` to be a child of
  `Assets:Super:CSS`:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -l 'd<=[30/06/2006]' -w -s bal ^Assets:Super
         $171,819.90  Assets:Super
          $12,777.87    ARF
         $159,042.03    CSS
           $3,861.00      Contributions
--------------------
         $171,819.90
  :END:

  However the ledger `equity` report formats `Contributions` as a new
  top-level account:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -l 'd<=[30/06/2006]' -w equity ^Assets:Super

14/07/2006 Opening Balances
    Assets:Super:ARF                      $12,777.87
    Assets:Super:CSS                     $155,181.03
    Contributions                          $3,861.00
                                        $-171,819.90
  :END:

  Whilst its no great issue to manually edit the report (have to change the
  date anyway) its slightly annoying.

* TODO [#B] FR: Add the concept of spatially delimited "pages"
  Another way to associate a custag tag/field to entries is by virtue of their
  organisation in the file. We could tag a sequence of consecutive entries in
  a block, like this:
  :DATA:
@page_begin Vacations

...

@page_end
  :END:

  This gives us yet another dimension of tagging of transactions:
  
  - The account in which a transaction belongs
  - The page in which a transaction was declared.
  - The "notes" at the end of postings
  - The description of the transaction
  - The file in which a transaction was defined.
  
  These are all fields that can be used for selecting a subset of
  transactions. Some of these fields may allow us to simplify our accounts
  hierarchy to some extent.

  So, 240 USD and -200 EUR, which implies an aggregate exchange rate of 1.2,
  which is wildly different of the 1.4 EUR/USD rate declared above.
  
  (Do you fill in? In my Python version, I'll prefer not to, because I think
  that in general these will be errors rather than reflect implied rates.)

  Use the following ledger data
  :DATA:
2004/05/01 * Checking balance
  Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00
  Equity:Opening Balances
  :END:

  With cursor on the beginning of the second line, eval
  `(ledger-context-at-point)`, which returns:
  :OUTPUT:
(acct-transaction account ((indent "  " 31) (account "Assets:Bank:Checking        1000.00" 33)))
  :END:
  It is not correct, since 1000.00 ought to be amount.

  ledger-context-at-point also fails to parse amount with ',' in it, such as:

* TODO [#B] Problem with piping input to ledger
  I decided to just go ahead and push my whole ledger file through "print".
  At first I had been a little nervous about the possibility that I might goof
  up somehow and lose some data.  But it seems to have worked okay: I did a
  spot check of the result by verifying that my checking account and credit
  card accounts still end up with the same final balance as they did before.
  Also, I typically save any edits to my ledger file in a Subversion
  repository, so I can always get back to a previous version if I need to.

  So now I do have a nice, clean file.

  After I got your message, I did try the "output" command.  I guess I didn't
  understand exactly what it's supposed to be doing, because it didn't quite
  seem to work as I expected.

  If I type:
  :SCRIPT:
ledger -f foo output foo
  :END:
  is it supposed to rewrite foo?  It didn't seem to do that.  Instead, it
  seems to write its output onto stdout.  And not only that, it seems to
  duplicate the last entry in the file.

  For example, if this is my sample file foo:
  :DATA:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage              $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                     $50.00

Y2005

01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                  $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking

2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  Then when I run `ledger -f foo output foo` the output I get is this:
  :OUTPUT:
2006/01/01 * Xyzzy Mortgage Co.
    Assets:Bank:Checking                  $-1,000.00
    Expenses:Interest:Mortage                $950.00
    Liabilities:Mortgage                      $50.00

Y2005

2005/01/01 * (1830) TPC
    Expenses:Phone                           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking

2005/02/03 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing                        $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
2/3 (1832) ABC Dept Store
    Expenses:Clothing           $100.00
    Assets:Bank:Checking
  :END:

  If instead I run `ledger -f foo output foo2`, then I get this:
  :OUTPUT:
Error: Journal does not refer to file ''
  :END:
  So I guess that wan't what I was supposed to do.

  Anyway, this is all just academic, 'cuz as I say I now have a nice, cleaned
  up file, thanks to the "print" command.

* TODO [#C] Use Python to create a per-account debit/credit report     :FEATURE:
  Is there a way to let ledger output its reports showing the accounts in the
  more conventional way as debit and credit accounts, instead of having a
  positive or negative saldo?

  Here is one example:
  :OUTPUT:
Assets:Bank
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor		500				500
2	2008-01-02	Bill					100		400

Income:Donations
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
1	2008-01-01	Mr. Sponsor				500		-500

Expenses:Electricity
Tr.#	date		Text			debit		credit		saldo
2	2008-01-02	Bill			100				100
  :END:
  There should be a way of distinguishing between debit accounts, as assets
  and expenses, and credit accounts, as Income and liabilities. It is of
  course possible to processs ledger's output to achieve this, but it would be
  nice if it could be done in ledger directly.

* TODO [#C] Add an entry type for specifying value constraints
  I'd like to see a more general syntax for this based on value expressions,
  which would offer a full constraints mechanism.  For example, to constrain
  all transactions to being less than $10,000 in an account:
  :DATA:
? Constrain all transactions to less than $10,000
  /Expenses:Food/      a < $10,000
  :END:

  The "?" indicates a "constraints entry".  Each transaction would have two
  value expressions: one to match every applicable transaction in the file,
  and another to provide the boolean logic of the constraint.

  Then, while the file is being parsed, any violations of a constraint would
  be treated as an error, the same as when an entry fails to balance to zero.
  I suppose making these warnings could be a possibility as well.

  Here is how you'd constrain commodities in this model:
  :DATA:
? Guarantee commodities within accounts
  Assets:Checking    comm(a) == $1.00
  :END:

  (At the moment there is no value expr function that would allow: comm(a) ==
  "$")

  Then, of course, there could be a specific declaration option -- such as you
  have above -- for just this case, which internally would be parsed as a
  constraints entry.

* TODO [#C] Added a {{total}} syntax for lot price specification       :FEATURE:
  I had another idea: do you remember I mentioned a problem I had, which that
  some of my trade confirmation slips provide the "adjusted cost base" and not
  the cost-per-share? This makes it a big ugly to enter such postings, even
  with expressions:
  :DATA:  
    BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {353.51435/29.435 USD} @ 13.02 USD
  :END:
  (I didn't test the above, by the way, that was your suggestion when we
  talked last time.)
  
  I propose this syntax:
  :DATA:  
    BrokerAccount    -29.435 WIDGETS {{353.51435 USD}} @ 13.02 USD
  :END:
  It's a bit similar to the idea of @ vs. @@ where the single char (@) is for
  price, and the double (@@) is for total amount. Using {{ ... }} refers to
  the total cost, while { ... } refers to the cost price (per share).

  I've been playing with budget feature in 2.4.  So far I've learned to make

  transactions, which is very useful.  However I can't make it show how
  budgets for next month are balanced.  The obvious (for me) command:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger -Bs --budget -p "next month" bal ^inc ^exp

  shows nothing unless I add an empty transaction on someday next month, which
  is weird, and not any kind of transaction will work.  Are there better ways

    I agree that we need something like this.  Also, whatever format is chosen, we
    should look at adding a flexible properties/tags/annotation mechanism for
    entries and transactions.
  12:47 < Demosthenes> i think we need a comment or further descriptive field that is preserved with the record
  12:47 < Nafai> That would probably be useful
  12:48 < Nafai> I can imagine, for example, in the future if I start scanning all of my receipts and such.  I'd like to be able to associate an entry with a given scan file
  12:48 < Nafai> I would do that via a comment, I suppose
  12:48 < Nafai> I'd bring it up on the mailing list and see what johnw thinks
  12:48 < Demosthenes> i was thinking expense report notes ;]
  13:02 < Demosthenes> if there were to be a comment, how would we make it look?
  13:03 < Demosthenes> my immediate suggestion would be to keep it freeform and use the ;, just that the parser would preserve the comments in the same text block as the ledger entry bounded by whitespace
  13:43 < Nafai> Yeah, that sounds reasonable
  14:16 < Demosthenes> then as an extension,  /^; ([A-Z][a-z]+): (.*)$/ could match key : value pairs for tags ;] 
  14:17 < Nafai> Nice
  14:24 < Demosthenes> good news is, i can go ahead and write comments that way, and we'll see if its added later ;]
  15:22 < johnw> let me show you what I'm thinking of, in the spirit of Python
  15:23 < johnw> http://rafb.net/p/jyagP679.html
  15:25 < johnw> so, ; inside an entry will be a note, ; outside is a comment

    This has been implemented.
  The emacs report uses byte-positioning to indicate the beginning of entries
  and transactions.  This breaks with multi-byte files.

  The solution is either to support multi-byte correctly, or to use line
  numbering instead.  levin has offered a patch for this (attached).

  I found a tiny bug in the info documentation for ledger, version
  2.6.0.90, regarding per-unit and complete transaction cost.  There
  seems to be @'s missing (maybe texinfo gobbles up at least on @)

  It says:

  > The `ACCOUNT' may be surrounded by parentheses if it is a virtual
  > transactions, or square brackets if it is a virtual transactions
  > that must balance.  The `AMOUNT' can be followed by a per-unit
  > transaction cost, by specifying ` AMOUNT', or a complete
  > transaction cost with `@ AMOUNT'.  Lastly

  whereas I believe (from reading the source of textual.cc) it should
  be:

  > The `ACCOUNT' may be surrounded by parentheses if it is a virtual
  > transactions, or square brackets if it is a virtual transactions
  > that must balance.  The `AMOUNT' can be followed by a per-unit
  > transaction cost, by specifying `@ AMOUNT', or a complete
  > transaction cost with `@@ AMOUNT'.  Lastly
