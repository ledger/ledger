ACCOUNTING GLOSSARY
---

  Accounting and bookkeeping represent an entire field of human effort and has
  evolved its own specialized vocabulary.  Accounting hopes to summarize and
  add understanding to where the money is going.

**Account**: A category for grouping together amounts from similar
  transactions.  Each account has a name, which is usually capitalized, and an
  account type.  Accounts are often organized into a hierarchy when it helps
  understanding.  For example, a coffee shop might have Coffee, Merchandise,
  and Equipment as accounts but arranged under an Inventory account because
  different decisions are made on the total inventory rather than just coffee.
  A hierarchy can be part of the account name in Ledger, e.g.,
  "Assets:Inventory:Coffee".  Note that the Ledger software usually creates
  the list of accounts on the fly: accounts are created when transactions use
  them.

**Account Type**: Each account has a type of Asset, Liability, Equity, Income,
  or Expense.  Assets represent something owned, e.g., Cash or Inventory.
  Liabilities represent sometime owed, e.g., a Loan or Mortgage.  Equity, also
  called capital, is everything owned minus everything owed (Assets -
  Liabilities).  It is the financial measure of how much you are ahead.
  Income is money earned somewhere, which puts you more ahead.  Expenses is
  money spent somewhere, which puts you less ahead.  The type of account
  determines if a debit represents an increase or decrease in an account.  For
  example, Inventory is an asset so a transaction debiting Inventory would
  increase its value.  Assets and Expenses increase with debits and decrease
  with credits; Liabilities, Equity, and Expenses increase with credits and
  decrease with debits.

**Journal**: A record of all the financial transactions of a person or firm.
  This data of where money goes can be collated into reports.  This used to be
  done with a physical book, called a ledger, where each account was on one
  page.  Each debit or credit in the journal was transferred to the
  appropriate account page and the pages were totalled to produce reports.
  This process is now done with the Ledger software which creates reports from
  the journal.  A journal is sometimes called a register.

**Posting**: A single debit or credit line of a transaction.  A posting
  comprises an account and the debit or credit amount.  It also inherits the
  shared description and date from the transaction.  In the Ledger software,
  a posting may also have metadata and an account state.


**Report**: A summary made from a journal of transactions.  Each transaction
  affects accounts and those effects are collated and totaled.  The two most
  common reports are the balance sheet, which shows what is owned and owed on
  a specific date, and the cash flow statement, which shows how money was
  earned and spent over a period.  The cash flow statement is also called
  a profit and loss statement or an income statement.

**Transaction**: Our financial lives are recorded as a series of transactions.
  Each transaction has a specific date, an equal total of debits and credits
  affecting accounts, and some sort of description.  For example, "On January
  1, pay $100 with check #243 from Checking to Utilities for my Verizon phone
  bill" is a transaction.  A credit of $100 decreases my Checking asset, while
  a balancing debit of $100 increases my Utility expense.  A transaction needs
  at least two *postings*, meaning account debits or credits, but can be as
  complicated as humans can make finances.

The Ledger software also has its own terms.

**Automated Transaction**: a command directive that modifies subsequent
  transactions that match an expression.  An automated transaction can add
  additional postings to a transaction, add metadata, or change transaction
  amounts.  Reports can be filter postings modified or generated by an
  automated transaction.

  [&sect; Concrete Example of Automated Transactions](http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Concrete-Example-of-Automated-Transactions)

**Command Directive**: a command in a journal file to change how subsequent
  lines and transactions in a journal file are processed.  Command directives
  control processing, set default values for subsequent accounts and
  transactions, or override parts of subsequent transactions.  A directive
  line begins with name of the directive and may have additional arguments or
  additional indented lines.  The single letters *AbCDhIiNOoY* are aliased to
  other command directives, providing compatibility with the ancient past.
  The characters **'='** and **'-'** are command directives for a automatic
  transactions and periodic transactions, respectively.
  [&sect; Command Directives](http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Command-Directives)

**Commodity**: any currency, stock, time or resource to be tracked
  numerically.  While many people only track money in Ledger, Ledger can track
  different resources and manage rules to convert between them.  The system is
  flexible enough for the needs of very different users.  Some track billable
  time, converting minutes and hours into dollars.  Others track multiple
  currencies.  Still others track the purchase and sale of stocks.  Each
  commodity is separate unless a conversion rule is given.

**Effective Date**: an optional, second date information item in for a posting
  or transaction.  Some use the effective date for when work is billed or when
  a check has cleared.  The `--effective-date` option causes the effective
  date to override the transaction's initial date for that report.
  [&sect; Effective Dates](http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Effective-Dates);

**Journal File**: the text input file for ledger, sometimes called a register
  file.  A journal file is a series of transactions, command directives, and
  comments.  Command directives start with the single word name of the
  directive at the beginning of the line and include any following indented
  lines.  Transactions start with a date a the beginning of the line and
  include any indented lines following.  The journal file is expected to be
  encoded as ASCII or UTF-8 text.

**Periodic Transaction**: the estimate of a transaction that would occur
  periodically, e.g., a monthly expense.  These estimates are only used in
  budgeting and forecasting reports using the `--budget`, `--forecast`, or
  `--unbudgeted` options.
  [&sect; Budgeting and Forecasting](http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Budgeting-and-Forecasting)

**Transaction Code**: an optional item in a transaction or posting often used
  to record a check number or bank code.  Certain custom reports can report
  this code.

**Transaction Metadata**: a term for comments and tags annotating
  a transaction.  Comments indented with a transaction will be stored with
  each posting of a transaction.  Tags are words in comments followed by
  colons.  Tags can be used as filters in reports and certain tags, "Payee" or
  "Value", may affect fields of the transaction.

**Transaction State**: a state of *cleared*, *pending*, or *uncleared* on each
  posting.  The state is usually set for an entire transaction at once with
  a mark after the date.  The marks are **&#42;** (cleared), **!** (pending),
  or no mark (uncleared).  The interpretation of this state is up to the user,
  but is typically used in bank reconciliations or differentiating time worked
  versus billed.  Ledger supports reports and filters based on state.

**Virtual Posting**: an annotation posting in a transaction, similar in form
  as a regular posting but not required to balance debits and credits.  It is
  often used to support
  [Fund Accounting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund_accounting) and various
  reports will collate and summarize virtual postings.  Virtual postings
  should not be confused with virtual posting costs.
