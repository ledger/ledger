            "thought": "Now I can see the duplication clearly. In the `parse_post` function in `textual_xacts.cc`:\n\n**First computation (lines 561-631)**: Computes `diff` by:\n1. Getting `account_total` (optionally stripping annotations based on `strip`)\n2. Subtracting account_total from `amt` to get `diff`\n3. Subtracting previous posts in the xact from `diff`\n4. If `amt` has a commodity, restricting `diff` to that commodity\n\n**Second computation (lines 636-660)**: When `strip` is true and we're in a balance assignment (post->amount.is_null()) and diff is not zero, it recomputes the same calculation but WITHOUT stripping annotations:\n1. Gets `ann_total` (account total without stripping)\n2. Subtracts ann_total from `amt` to get `ann_diff`\n3. Subtracts previous posts (without stripping) from `ann_diff`\n\nThe purpose of the second computation is to preserve lot annotations. The first computation strips annotations to check if the balance differs; the second preserves them so the assigned amount retains lot information.\n\ndbear496's suggestion: Either detect upfront whether to preserve annotations, or extract the computation into a subroutine called twice with different parameters.\n\nThe cleanest approach is to extract the diff computation into a helper function that takes a `strip` parameter. Something like:\n\n```cpp\nbalance_t compute_balance_diff(const amount_t& amt, post_t* post, xact_t* xact, \n                                bool strip, parse_context_t& context);\n```\n\nThis function would:\n1. Get account_total, optionally stripping\n2. Compute diff = amt - account_total\n3. Subtract previous posts (optionally stripping their amounts)\n4. If amt has commodity, restrict to that commodity\n5. Return diff\n\nThen in the balance assignment path:\n- Call it with `strip=true` to check if there's a difference\n- If strip was true and diff is not zero, call it again with `strip=false` to get the annotated diff\n\nWait, but the second computation doesn't do the commodity restriction step. Let me re-read...\n\nActually looking more carefully at the second block (lines 636-660):\n- It computes ann_diff but does NOT do the commodity restriction step\n- It just subtracts account total and previous posts\n\nAnd the first block (lines 561-631) does:\n- Subtract account total\n- Subtract previous posts  \n- Commodity restriction\n\nSo they're not quite identical. But the core subtraction logic IS the same. Let me think about the best refactoring approach.\n\nActually, I think the best approach is a helper that computes the diff from account total and previous posts, parameterized by whether to strip. The commodity restriction is only needed for the first (stripped) computation to check zero, not for the annotated recomputation.\n\nLet me design this:\n\n```cpp\nstatic balance_t compute_balance_diff(\n    const amount_t& amt, post_t* post, xact_t* xact,\n    bool strip_annotations, parse_context_t& context)\n{\n    value_t account_total(\n        post->account->self_total(\n            !(post->has_flags(POST_VIRTUAL) || post->has_flags(POST_IS_TIMELOG))));\n    if (strip_annotations)\n        account_total = account_total.strip_annotations(keep_details_t());\n\n    balance_t diff = amt;\n\n    switch (account_total.type()) {\n    case value_t::AMOUNT: {\n        amount_t acct_amt(account_total.as_amount());\n        diff -= acct_amt.reduced();\n        break;\n    }\n    case value_t::BALANCE: {\n        balance_t bal(account_total.as_balance());\n        diff -= bal;\n        break;\n    }\n    default:\n        break;\n    }\n\n    for (post_t* p : xact->posts) {\n        if (p->account == post->account &&\n            ((p->has_flags(POST_VIRTUAL) || p->has_flags(POST_IS_TIMELOG)) ==\n             (post->has_flags(POST_VIRTUAL) || post->has_flags(POST_IS_TIMELOG)))) {\n            amount_t p_amt(strip_annotations ? p->amount.strip_annotations(keep_details_t()) : p->amount);\n            diff -= p_amt;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return diff;\n}\n```\n\nThen in the main code:\n1. `diff = compute_balance_diff(amt, post.get(), xact, strip, context)` \n2. Apply commodity restriction to diff\n3. In balance assignment when strip && !diff.is_zero():\n   `ann_diff = compute_balance_diff(amt, post.get(), xact, false, context)`\n   Then try to use ann_diff.to_amount(), falling back to diff.to_amount()\n\nWait, but in the current second computation, when strip is false (i.e., amt has annotations), it doesn't re-strip the previous posts' amounts. Looking at line 658: `ann_diff -= p->amount;` — this uses the raw amount without stripping. And in the first computation at line 610: `amount_t p_amt(strip ? p->amount.strip_annotations(keep_details_t()) : p->amount);` — when strip is false, it also uses raw amount. So `compute_balance_diff(amt, post, xact, false, ...)` would use raw amounts for everything, which matches the second computation.\n\nThe only subtle difference: in the second computation, the amount subtracted from the account total uses `.reduced()` only for AMOUNT case (line 645-646: `ann_diff -= ann_total.as_amount().reduced()`). The first computation also uses `.reduced()` at line 582-583. So they match.\n\nThis refactoring looks clean. Let me also keep the DEBUG statements. Actually, the DEBUG lines are numerous and specific to each call site. I think for a clean refactoring, I can either:\n1. Include the DEBUG statements in the helper (but they reference `context.linenum` so the helper would need context)\n2. Keep DEBUG statements at the call sites by having the helper return the diff without DEBUG\n\nI'll include a few key DEBUG statements in the helper since the context is already available. But to keep it simple and focused, I might leave the more detailed DEBUG lines at the call sites.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, the simplest and cleanest approach that matches dbear496's suggestion is to extract the computation into a helper function. The DEBUG macros can go in the helper since we pass context. Let me plan the implementation.\n",
