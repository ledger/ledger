Write and run tests to verify the fix\n7. Ensure code passes linting and type checking\n8.

After installing:\n\n    $ python -c \"import ledger; print(ledger)\"\n\n### Using Without Installing\n\nTo use the module directly from the build tree without installing, point\n`PYTHONPATH` at the build directory:\n\n    $ PYTHONPATH=build python -c \"import ledger; print(ledger)\"\n\nOn Linux you may also need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build`, and on macOS\n`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=build`.\n\nA demo script is included at `python/demo.py`:\n\n    $ PYTHONPATH=build python python/demo.py\n\nFor full documentation of the Python API, see the \"Extending with Python\"\nchapter in the [Ledger manual](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html).\n\n[Boost.Python]: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/python/\n\n## Resources",

Python\nsupport is **off by default** and must be explicitly enabled.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nIn addition to the standard [dependencies](#dependencies), you need:\n\n- Python 3.10 or later (with development headers)\n- Boost.Python (matching your Boost and Python versions)\n\nSee the platform-specific dependency sections above for package names (e.g.\n`boost-python3` on Homebrew, `libboost-python-dev` on Ubuntu).\n\n### Building with Python Support\n\nUsing `acprep`:\n\n    $ ./acprep --python update --output=build\n\nOr using CMake directly:\n\n    $ mkdir build && cd build\n    $ cmake -DUSE_PYTHON=ON ..\n    $ make -j$(nproc)\n\n### Installing the Python Module\n\nRunning `make install` (or `cmake --install build`) copies `ledger.so` (or\n`ledger.pyd` on Windows) into your Python installation's `site-packages`\ndirectory. After installing:\n\n    $ python -c \"import ledger; print(ledger)\"\n\n### Using Without Installing\n\nTo use the module directly from the build tree without installing, point\n`PYTHONPATH` at the build directory:\n\n    $ PYTHONPATH=build python -c \"import ledger; print(ledger)\"\n\nOn Linux you may also need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build`, and on macOS\n`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=build`.\n\nA demo script is included at `python/demo.py`:\n\n    $ PYTHONPATH=build python python/demo.py\n\nFor full documentation of the Python API, see the \"Extending with Python\"\nchapter in the [Ledger manual](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html).\n\n[Boost.Python]: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/python/\n\n## Resources",

Each commit should represent one coherent change that can be understood, reviewed, and reverted independently.\n\n# Commit Decomposition Principles\n\n**Scope each commit to a single logical change.** A commit should do exactly one thing: add a function, fix a bug, refactor a module, update documentation. If you find yourself writing \"and\" in a commit message, consider splitting the commit.\n\n**Sequence commits to tell a story.** Arrange commits so each builds naturally on the previous. A reviewer reading the series should understand why each change was made and how the code evolved. Foundational changes come before dependent ones.\n\n**Keep each commit in a working state.** Every commit should compile, pass tests, and not introduce obvious regressions. This enables bisection for debugging and allows reviewers to check out any point in history.\n\n# Categorizing Changes\n\nBefore committing, analyze the working tree and group changes into categories:\n\n1. **Infrastructure/setup changes** — new dependencies, configuration, tooling\n2. **Refactoring** — restructuring existing code without changing behavior\n3. **New functionality** — features, APIs, modules\n4. **Bug fixes** — corrections to existing behavior\n5. **Tests** — new or modified test coverage\n6. **Documentation** — comments, READMEs, inline docs\n\nCommit these categories in order when dependencies exist between them. Refactoring that enables a new feature should precede the feature commit.\n\n# Commit Message Format\n\n```\n<summary>\n\n<body>\n\n<footer>\n```\n\n**Summary line:** Imperative mood, no period, under 50 characters. Describe what applying the commit does, not what you did.\n\n**Body:** Explain the motivation and contrast with previous behavior. Wrap at 72 characters. Focus on *why*, not *what* (the diff shows what).\n\n**Footer:** Reference issues, breaking changes, or co-authors.\n\n# Staging Strategy\n\nUse selective staging to craft precise commits:\n\n- `git add -p` for hunks within files\n- `git add <specific-files>` to group related files\n- Review staged changes with `git diff --staged` before committing\n\nWhen a single file contains changes belonging to multiple logical commits, stage hunks separately rather than committing the entire file.\n\n# Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing each commit:\n\n- [ ] Does this commit do exactly one thing?\n- [ ] Could someone understand this change without seeing other commits?\n- [ ] Is the commit message searchable? Will someone find this when grepping history?\n- [ ] Does the code compile and pass tests at this point?\n- [ ] Would reverting this commit cleanly undo one logical change?\n\n# Example Decomposition\n\nGiven work that adds a feature with tests and required refactoring:\n\n```\n1. Extract token validation into dedicated module\n2. Add unit tests for token validation\n3. Implement refresh token rotation\n4. Add integration tests for token refresh flow\n5. Document refresh token behavior in API guide\n```\n\nEach commit is independently reviewable, the sequence shows logical progression, and future developers can find relevant changes through targeted searches.\n\n# Handling Mixed Changes\n\nIf the working tree contains entangled changes:\n\n1. **Identify the distinct changes** — list what logical modifications exist\n2. **Determine dependencies** — which changes require others to be present\n3. **Create a commit plan** — order commits to satisfy dependencies\n4. **Stage incrementally** — use partial staging to isolate each change\n5. **Verify at each step** — ensure the repository works after each commit\n\nWhen changes are too entangled to separate cleanly, prefer a slightly larger commit with a clear message over a commit that leaves the repository in a broken state.\n",
