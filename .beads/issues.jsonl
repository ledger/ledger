{"id":"ledger-112","title":"Slow account directives processing","description":"Account `check` directives are one kind of auto transactions and kept inside `journal.auto_xacts` list. Thus all posts need to loop all entries in `auto_xacts`. In other words, its time complexity is O(m*n) if n=number of posts and m=number of auto transactions.\r\n\r\nWhy this is an issue: I am a new user of ledger and I converted my gnucash book to ledger. However, the conversion tools ([1](https://github.com/sdementen/piecash/blob/master/piecash/ledger.py) and [2](https://github.com/MatzeB/pygnucash/blob/master/gnucash2ledger.py)) will add \"check\" directives to ALL accounts like\r\n```\r\naccount Assets:Investments:Stock\r\n    check commodity == \"USD\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy book has 247 accounts and 7k transactions (12 years). Simple operations like `ledger bal` takes 4.2 seconds, which is too slow. If removed those `check` directives, it takes only 0.56 seconds.\r\n\r\nI guess it is possible to optimize above case by treating account directives differently to normal automatic transaction directives. That is, for account directives, grouping them by account name (instead of using general predicate expression). Then `journal_t::extend_xact` can look up the group by account name and reduce the cost of looping.\r\n\r\np.s. due to some compiler issues, I am unable to build gprof flavor and thus unfortunately unable to provide profiling numbers.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2018-04-13T14:44:16Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.384833-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/562"}

{"id":"ledger-113","title":"\"Only one posting with null amount allowed per transaction\" when it seemingly should be inferrable","description":"Disclaimer: I'm quite new to Ledger and had only a very vague understanding of double-entry bookkeeping prior to picking it up, so it's entirely possible that the current behavior is for a very good reason and I'd appreciate knowing why.\r\n\r\nMy issue is this: Why is the following not allowed?\r\n\r\n    2018/04/10 * Adagio Teas\r\n        [Assets:Funds:Reserves:Liabilities]\t\t\t$   82.00\r\n        [Assets:Funds:Toys]\r\n        Expenses:Thingamabobs\t\t\t\t\t$   82.00\r\n        Liabilities:Discover\r\n\r\nThe only way to make this balance that I can see is to apply postings of -82.00 to Assets:Funds:Toys and -82.00 to Liabilities:Discover -- the real accounts have to balance and the virtual accounts have to balance. I couldn't apply +500.00 to Assets:Funds:Toys and then -582.00 to Liabilities:Discover, for instance, because then the real postings would not balance. When there's only one possible way to balance the transaction, I would expect that Ledger would accept null values for those postings.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context (probably not necessary, but just in case)\r\nI use Ledger to budget with virtual \"envelope\"-style funds, because I like budgeting what I'm going to do with each paycheck or each month rather than planning out fixed monthly amounts. So after I get some income, I issue transactions something like the following:\r\n\r\n    2018/04/08 * Paycheck\r\n        Assets:Bank:Checking $ 500.00\r\n        Income:MyWorkplace  $ -500.00\r\n\r\n    2018/04/08 * Distribution\r\n        [Assets:Funds:Charity]                \t\t\t\t$  100.00\r\n        [Assets:Funds:Home:Rent]\t\t\t\t\t$  250.00\r\n        [Assets:Funds:Utilities:Internet and Phone]\t\t$  150.00\r\n        ...\r\n        [Assets:Bank:Checking]\t\t\t\t\t\t$ -500.00\r\n\r\nThen when I want to spend money, there are four accounts per transaction, two real and two virtual. Something like:\r\n\r\n    2018/04/10 * Adagio Teas\r\n        [Assets:Funds:Reserves:Liabilities]\t\t\t$   82.00\r\n        [Assets:Funds:Toys]\t\t\t\t\t        $  -82.00\r\n        Expenses:Thingamabobs\t\t\t\t\t$   82.00\r\n        Liabilities:Discover\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$  -82.00\r\n\r\n(When the credit card gets paid off, there's another transaction paying it from the Reserves virtual account to the card.)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2018-04-16T00:12:48Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.384603-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/563"}

{"id":"ledger-1198","title":"include statement with wild card does not use a predictable order","description":"I have a directory with the files Q1.ledger, Q2.ledger, Q3.ledger, Q4.ledger and a main ledger file that has the line: `include Q*.ledger`\r\n\r\nHowever, ledger includes the files in seemingly random order, not Q1, Q2,… as hoped. This causes a problem if you have any expressions such as `check` statements that are dependent on the correct order. The order is consistent between runs, but not from one machine to another which caused a hard to track problem for us.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\nCreate a test.ledger file with the line `include Q*.ledger` and several files Q{1,2,3,4}.ledger with this:\r\n```\r\n2018-01-01 Test\r\n    Assets                       1000.00 USD\r\n    Test\r\n\r\ncheck account(\"Assets\").amount == 999.00 USD\r\n```\r\nNow a `ledger -f test.ledger bal`  will give:\r\n```\r\nWarning: \"…/Q4.ledger\", line 5: Check failed: account(\"Assets\").amount == 999.00 USD\r\nWarning: \"…/Q2.ledger\", line 5: Check failed: account(\"Assets\").amount == 999.00 USD\r\nWarning: \"…/Q1.ledger\", line 5: Check failed: account(\"Assets\").amount == 999.00 USD\r\nWarning: \"…/Q3.ledger\", line 5: Check failed: account(\"Assets\").amount == 999.00 USD\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mitigation**\r\nThe obvious workaround is to rewrite the `include Q*.ledger` to this:\r\n```\r\ninclude Q1.ledger\r\ninclude Q2.ledger\r\ninclude Q3.ledger\r\n…\r\n```\r\nWhile the mitigation is easy enough, albeit a little cumbersome, it would be a nice feature if the include files were sorted to prevent anyone else running into unexpected behaviour.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2018-07-01T09:55:17Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.379934-08:00","closed_at":"2020-11-03T06:52:23Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/1659"}

{"id":"ledger-1277","title":"Currencies with Many Decimal Places","description":"Although most currencies have 2 decimal places and perhaps up to 4 when trading, a large number of cryptocurrencies have a *very* large number of decimal places.  Bitcoin for example has 8, and Ethereum (and a large number of coins based on Ethereum) have 18 decimal places.  This is handled fine internal by Ledger; however, there are certain formatting issues.\r\n\r\nHere is an example ledger:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommodity USD\r\n    note United States Dollar\r\n    format USD 1,000.00\r\ncommodity BTC\r\n    note Bitcoin\r\n    format BTC 1,000.00000000\r\ncommodity ETH\r\n    note Ether\r\n    format ETH 1,000.000000000000000000\r\n\r\n2019-01-01 * Opening balance\r\n    Equity:Adjustment\r\n    Assets:Bank                                   USD 1,000.00\r\n\r\n2019-01-02 * Buy ETH with USD\r\n    Assets:Crypto                                     ETH 1.23 @ USD 200.00\r\n    Assets:Bank\r\n\r\n2019-01-03 * Buy BTC with ETH\r\n    Assets:Crypto                                     BTC 0.34 @ ETH 1.98\r\n    Assets:Crypto\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that although ETH handles 18 decimal places of precision (and all transactions ultimately have this precision), various exchanges will differ in what precision they use/round to.\r\n\r\nHere are a few issues what arise from such a large number of decimal places\r\n\r\n- [ ] Number format are very difficult to read.  In the same way that we have thousands separator, it could be nice if we could have thousandths separators.  This is a purely aesthetic issue, but one suggestion would be to use underscores: `ETH 1,000.123_456_789_123_456_789`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The balance sheet do not display correctly:\r\n  ```\r\n        BTC 0.34000000\r\n  ETH 0.556800000000000000\r\n            USD 754.00  Assets\r\n            USD 754.00    Bank\r\n        BTC 0.34000000\r\n  ETH 0.556800000000000000    Crypto\r\n  --------------------\r\n        BTC 0.34000000\r\n  ETH 0.556800000000000000\r\n            USD 754.00\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\nThese are the only two places I've seen an issue so far, though I have not looked for many other places yet.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2019-05-26T02:06:04Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.35899-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/1795"}

{"id":"ledger-1280","title":"lots not working the way I expected (hoped)","description":"I'm a newbie to ledger, but have been reading.  I'm unable to get lots to work correctly.  It seems like when I specify a lot, ledger doesn't try to balance that portion of a transaction.  I wonder if that's a bug (or user error).\r\n\r\nI'm on fedora and `ledger -version` reports `Ledger 3.1.1-20160111`.\r\n\r\nIn my test data (below), I'm simulating some crypto trades.  A relatively simple transaction selling \"ABC\" for USD seems to work ok.  I was hoping ledger would do the right thing if I trade \"ABC\" for \"WTF\", but it doesn't balance the transaction the way I've entered it.\r\n\r\nI noticed that if I make a transaction that is clearly unbalanced, but specifies a lot, ledger doesn't care that it is unbalanced.  Ledger doesn't complain if I change my third transaction to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2017/03/01 This transaction is only a debit with no offsetting credit!\r\n           Assets:Crypto        -10 ABC {0.02 USD} [2014/01/01] @ 1 USD\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I structure the transaction the way I'd like it to work, ledger does complain that it doesn't balance.  It's as if it is ignoring the first line item in the transaction.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2017/03/01 now trade for WTF\r\n           Assets:Crypto        -10 ABC {0.02 USD} [2014/01/01] @ 1 USD\r\n           Exchange:Coinboys    5 WTF @ 2 ABC\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the complete test I'm trying to run.  I'd appreciate any pointers how to represent these trades.\r\n\r\n```\r\n; ledger-cli test for crypto features\r\n\r\n; Somebody was giving away ABC, back when it was worth 2 cents.\r\n2014/01/01 receive some ABC\r\n           Assets:Crypto        100 ABC @ 0.02 USD\r\n           Income:AirDrop\r\n\r\n; The price of ABC rose to one dollar, I sold one.\r\n2017/02/01 sell ABC\r\n           ; must use \"{0.02 USD} [2014/01/01]\", \"{0.02 USD}\" alone does not work with --lots\r\n           Assets:Crypto        -1 ABC {0.02 USD} [2014/01/01] @ 1 USD\r\n           Exchange:Coinboys    1 USD\r\n           Income:Capital gains\r\n\r\n; So far, so good. (With some trouble figuring out how to name a lot.)\r\n\r\n; I'd like to represent a trade not involving USD.  Having trouble\r\n; here.  I haven't figured out how to make it balance...\r\n\r\n; Then I traded for some other crypto, worth say $2.\r\n2017/03/01 now trade for WTF\r\n           Assets:Crypto        -10 ABC {0.02 USD} [2014/01/01] @ 1 USD\r\n           Exchange:Coinboys    5 WTF @ 2 ABC      ; maybe should be \"... @ 2 USD\"\r\n           FIXME               ; ledger calculates \"-10 ABC\"\r\n\r\n; ledger balance for \"FIXME\" becomes \"-10 ABC\".

In that case the amount in the unknown account is assumed to be $0, and the transaction transfers the wrong amount.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen is that all the files should be imported first and sorted by date of transaction. All transactions should then be processed in order.

That could be the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nI'd like to use the `--balance-format` option with the default format but the modified color.\r\n\r\nThe docs give the default balance format to be:\r\n```\r\n\"%(justify(scrub(display_total), 20, -1, true, color))\"\r\n\"  %(!options.flat ? depth_spacer : \\\"\\\")\"\r\n\"%-(ansify_if(partial_account(options.flat), blue if color))\\n%/\"\r\n\"%$1\\n%/\"\r\n\"--------------------\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, first, when pasting that in my command-line, that does not work as the `--balance-format` expects only one string.

I tried to use the second syntax based on [this ledger cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/ledger), although it only mentions the syntax `%tag`, not explicitly `%tag=value`. I just checked `man ledger` as well and found that `tag regex (%regex)` is mentioned in the `QUERIES`section, but with no explanation. I mean, well, `%tag=value` seems to work, but I find the behavior confusing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n__And there is even more inconsistency to come. Both syntaxes get weird behavior when `apply tag` commands are present as well.__\r\n\r\nLet's assume file `test2.ldg` contains the contents of `test1.ldg` wrapped in two nested `apply tag`commands:\r\n```\r\napply tag month: A\r\n\r\napply tag month: B\r\n\r\n2020/01/01  Test\r\n    ; month: C\r\n    ; month: D\r\n    X  100\r\n    Y  -99   ; month: E\r\n    Z\r\n    ; month: F\r\n    ; month: G\r\n\r\nend tag\r\n\r\nend tag\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I filter for the month tag now, the results are as follows:\r\n```\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" -l \"tag('month') =~ /^A$/\"\r\nA20-Jan-01 Test                  X                       100                100\r\nA                                Y                       -99                  1\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" -l \"tag('month') =~ /^C$/\"\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" -l \"tag('month') =~ /^D$/\"\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" -l \"tag('month') =~ /^E$/\"\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" -l \"tag('month') =~ /^F$/\"\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" -l \"tag('month') =~ /^G$/\"\r\nG20-Jan-01 Test                  Z                        -1                 -1\r\n\r\n\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" %month=A\r\nA20-Jan-01 Test                  X                       100                100\r\nA                                Y                       -99                  1\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" %month=B\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" %month=C\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" %month=D\r\nA20-Jan-01 Test                  X                       100                100\r\nA                                Y                       -99                  1\r\nG                                Z                        -1                  0\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" %month=E\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" %month=F\r\n$ ledger -f test2.ldg reg --meta \"month\" %month=G\r\nG20-Jan-01 Test                  Z                        -1                 -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in the __first syntax__, first thing to note is that the _outer_ `apply tag` command now \"wins\" against the inner `apply tag` command, and also against the transaction tags (see posting for `X`). I would expect the _inner_ command to have priority (i.e. `month` should be set to `B`), and this should only happen if _neither the transaction or the posting have set their own tag with the same key._ In the case of posting `X`, the transaction should again override this to `D`.\r\n\r\nIn case of posting `Y`, the posting itself should override this to `E` for the same reason. It appears that for posting `Y`, the error occurs because the posting and `; month: E` are written on the same line. If I add a newline in between, the result is corrected. This would also explain why posting `Z` got the (IMHO) correct tag value `G`.\r\n\r\nFor the __second syntax__, the observation for `test1.ldg` still holds: It seems to _additionally_ take into account the _last value_ associated to the tag of the _transaction_, as if both values would apply to the tag of the posting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n__Are these behaviors really intentional? I'd regard them as bugs and suggest (a) that the first syntax should behave as I explained in the `test2.ldg` example, and (b) that the second syntax should behave identically and get proper documentation (or at least it should be documented why it behaves differently).__\r\n\r\n---\r\nsee also: https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/gsyh63/weird_behavior_when_trying_to_override_apply_tag/","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2020-06-04T13:28:03Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.337489-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/1922"}

Why?\r\n\r\nIf I try to just make the `assets:foodstamps` account increase without also drawing from it with a \"food expense\" like so:\r\n```\r\n~ Monthly\r\n  expenses:rent             -$450\r\n  expenses:car:insurance    -$44.33\r\n  expenses:web:email        -$6\r\n  expenses:web:phone        -$11.72\r\n  expenses:web:spotify      -$10.59\r\n  assets:checking\r\n\r\n~ Monthly\r\n  assets:foodstamps         $180\r\n  benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n2020/06/16 \r\n  assets:checking           $729.14\r\n  assets:foodstamps         $6.25\r\n  equity\r\n```\r\nmy `ledger --budget` report still shows the `assets:foodstamps` account as negative, having been subtracted from instead of added to.\r\n\r\nHow do I make an assets account increase in this periodic budget/forcasting way?","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2020-06-17T00:52:26Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.336168-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/1930"}

This feels inconsistent and makes stringent formatting difficult.\r\n\r\nIs it designed like so because multiple tags on one posting are required to be written on new lines anyway?

So if you have Assets:Current:Foo with 10.00 EUR and Assets:Current:Bar with 10.00 EUR, the tree view will show Assets:Current with 20.00 EUR as well as Assets with the same amount.  This behaviour is confusing to some users and we often tell them to use `--flat` instead, which doesn't show the totals for each level.\r\n\r\n... except it does, but only in *some* cases.  In the example I just gave, it does not happen:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-01-08 * Test\r\n    Assets:Current:Foo  10.00 EUR\r\n    Assets:Foo\r\n\r\n2020-01-08 * Test\r\n    Assets:Current:Bar  10.00 EUR\r\n    Assets:Foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n```\r\nledger -f d bal assets:current \r\n           20.00 EUR  Assets:Current\r\n           10.00 EUR    Bar\r\n           10.00 EUR    Foo\r\n--------------------\r\n           20.00 EUR\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\nledger -f d bal assets:current --flat\r\n           10.00 EUR  Assets:Current:Bar\r\n           10.00 EUR  Assets:Current:Foo\r\n--------------------\r\n           20.00 EUR\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is expected.\r\n\r\nBut now look at this example where we actually put something in the second level account directly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-01-08 * Test\r\n    Assets:Sub1:Sub2   10.00 EUR\r\n    Assets:Sub1        -5.00 EUR\r\n    Assets:Foo\r\n\r\n2020-01-08 * Test\r\n    Assets:Sub1:Sub3   10.00 GBP\r\n    Assets:Sub1        -5.00 GBP\r\n    Assets:Foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nledger -f d bal assets:sub1$\r\n           -5.00 EUR\r\n           -5.00 GBP  Assets:Sub1\r\n```\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n```\r\nledger -f d bal assets:sub1\r\n            5.00 EUR\r\n            5.00 GBP  Assets:Sub1\r\n           10.00 EUR    Sub2\r\n           10.00 GBP    Sub3\r\n--------------------\r\n            5.00 EUR\r\n            5.00 GBP\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, good so far.  But what about `--flat`?  Sure we would see the same result as the `bal :sub1$` query.  Except we don't:\r\n\r\n```\r\nledger -f d bal assets:sub1 --flat\r\n            5.00 EUR\r\n            5.00 GBP  Assets:Sub1\r\n           10.00 EUR  Assets:Sub1:Sub2\r\n           10.00 GBP  Assets:Sub1:Sub3\r\n--------------------\r\n            5.00 EUR\r\n            5.00 GBP\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is inconsistent because it didn't happen with the first test case.

{"id":"ledger-1412","title":"Tracking cashback?","description":"I'm brand new to ledger. One of the things I want it to do is track cash back. This seems like a perfect use case for automated transactions. However, my credit card company offers different levels of cash back depending on the expense. This means that the automated transaction would need to check multiple postings for each transaction before adding its posting: *If* a transaction with a debit from my credit card also contains one type of expense, then the automated transaction should add a posting for *one* level of cash back. *Otherwise*, the automated transaction should add a posting for a *different* level of cash back. In pseudocode, something like this:\n\n```\n= Liabilities:MasterCard and Expenses:Gas\n    Assets:Cash Back                           -0.02\n    Equity:MasterCard                           0.02\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n= Liabilities:MasterCard and not Expenses:Gas\n    Assets:Cash Back                           -0.01\n    Equity:MasterCard                           0.01\n```\n\nI can't see a way in the documentation to do this, which makes me think that perhaps this isn't a good use case for automated transactions.

I know, there are several workarounds, but they really seem to interfere with a streamlined KISS workflow.\r\n\r\nLooking here: https://groups.google.com/g/ledger-cli/c/ooxbPVRinSs?pli=1 and https://groups.google.com/g/ledger-cli/c/vwkrPh74NFI. I found, this is an issue for others too; and it keeps resurfacing in the discussions from time to time.\r\n\r\nTo be quite honest, I've tried the example given by John in the first thread:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2012-01-01 Test\r\n    Expenses:Unknown  $100.00\r\n    Liabilities:MasterCard\r\n\r\n2012-01-02 Test\r\n    Expenses:Unknown  $100.00\r\n    Liabilities:MasterCard\r\n\r\n2012-01-03 Test\r\n    Expenses:Unknown  $100.00\r\n    Liabilities:MasterCard\r\n\r\n2012-01-04 Test\r\n    ; UUID: foo\r\n    Liabilities:MasterCard  $300.00 = $0\r\n    Assets:Checking\r\n\r\n2012-01-01 Test\r\n    Assets:Checking  $150.00\r\n    Income\r\n\r\n2012-01-02 Test\r\n    Assets:Checking  $150.00\r\n    Income\r\n\r\n2012-01-03 Test\r\n    Assets:Checking  $150.00\r\n    Income\r\n\r\n2012-01-04 Test\r\n    ; UUID: foo\r\n    Liabilities:MasterCard  $300.00\r\n    Assets:Checking  $-300.00 = $150.00\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, when I run `ledger` on it, I get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ledger bal -f test.ldg \r\nWhile parsing file \"/home/pi/ledger-test/test.ldg\", line 33:\r\nWhile parsing posting:\r\n  Assets:Checking  $-300.00 = $150.00\r\n                              ^^^^^^^\r\nError: Balance assertion off by $300.00 (expected to see $-150.00)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can only get it working, if I sort the file before:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ledger print -f test.ldg --sort date --permissive | ledger bal -f -\r\n             $150.00  Assets:Checking\r\n             $300.00  Expenses:Unknown\r\n            $-450.00  Income\r\n--------------------\r\n                   0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could use this as a workaround, but then again, if there's any issue, the error messages would be useless because there are no file names or line numbers any more, when piping. Also, it feels like an annoying workaround, which keeps tripping me up here and there.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, however, I reckon, the same logic could be added internally to ledger to sort out this issue once and for all.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2021-03-02T13:24:42Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.317856-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2015"}

It seems to me that there should be some way to instruct --gain to take a starting time for the market valuation as a reference point, which must be distinct from the --begin date because that just excludes things like the Opening Balances transaction.\r\n\r\nhledger appears to be able to do the correct computation like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hledger -f test.ledger balance -N --gain brokerage date:2022\r\n             $300.00  Assets:Brokerage\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume that under the hood, hledger must be interpreting `date:2022` as an interval for market valuations, not a filter to exclude transactions.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2022-11-29T23:41:53Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.299744-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2146"}

{"id":"ledger-1524","title":"`--pedantic` and `--check-payees` with unexpected behavior","description":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI have been using ledger for roughly a decade. My journal has ~33k lines. I recently switched OS version and initially had ledger 3.2.1 installed after the update. I now updated to Ledger 3.3.0-20230208. I have issues with my journal that I haven't had before. I don't remember the ledger version that I was previously running (must have been a bit older).\r\n\r\nIn the past, I run ledger like so\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ type led\r\nled is aliased to `ledger -f main.txt --pedantic --check-payees --price-db prices.txt --market --explicit'\r\n```\r\n(I realize that as of today `--explicit` is not useful anymore. I'll remove it from now on).\r\n\r\nMy journal is full of entries like this ([download test.txt](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/files/10779833/test.txt)):\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommodity EUR\r\naccount Vermoegen:Girokonto\r\naccount Ausgaben:Haushalt:TelefonInternet\r\n\r\n2015/10/08 * 1u1 Telecom GmbH\r\n    ; CSV data:\r\n    ; from : \"08.10.2015\",\"08.10.2015\",\"LASTSCHRIFT\",\"1u1 Telecom GmbH\",\"KD-Nr.

As of today, I cannot inspect my journal anymore. The following still works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ledger -f test.txt -w reg\r\n15-Oct-08 1u1 Telecom GmbH                   Ausgaben:Haushalt:TelefonInternet                   19.99EUR             19.99EUR\r\n                                             Vermoegen:Girokonto                                -19.99EUR                    0\r\n```\r\nBeing pedantic doesn't work anymore:\r\n```\r\n$ ledger -f test.txt -w --pedantic reg\r\nWhile parsing file \"/run/mount/veracrypt4/Buchhaltung.git/test.txt\", line 10:\r\nError: Unknown metadata tag '(raw)'\r\n```\r\nThe docs say that a (metadata) tag is surrounded by two colons. This doesn't seem to be the case here. I can work around this problem by adapting [my format](https://github.com/rolfschr/GSWL-ecosystem/blob/master/convert.py#L154). Removing the colon will make the command succeed. Note how interestingly, the `from :` line doesn't cause any issue. Removing the parens also makes the command work again. I.e. either `raw: ...` or `(raw) ...` is fine but `(raw): ...` is not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I cannot use `--check-payees` neither anymore:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ledger -f test.txt -w --pedantic --check-payees reg\r\nWhile parsing file \"/run/mount/veracrypt4/Buchhaltung.git/test.txt\", line 5:\r\nWhile parsing transaction:\r\n\u003e 2015/10/08 * 1u1 Telecom GmbH\r\nError: Unknown payee '1u1 Telecom GmbH'\r\n```\r\n(Succeeds with `--strict` but gives the warning nevertheless). The docs say \"A line beginning with a number denotes a transaction.  [...]  The format of the first line is [...] Following these is the payee, or a description of the posting.\" It seems like I cannot use a \"desc\" here when using `--check-payees`.  This has definitely worked in the past.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor both cases, I'm not sure anything is wrong here. A [bug](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Payee-metadata-tag) is mentioned in the docs but I don't know whether this is related. Maybe the behavior is (now) expected and the docs are just misleading. The first issue feels a little bit like a bug to me, though.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the software a lot!","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2023-02-20T05:39:49Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.293809-08:00","closed_at":"2023-02-25T06:31:21Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2202"}

{"id":"ledger-1548","title":"What does the expr argument do in account_t::amount?","description":"I am thinking about adding a feature that would involve getting an account balance based on a filtered set of postings. I came across the [account_t::amount](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/blob/d556f3bcb10269ae6dc746ab75b6332cafb21b89/src/account.cc#L613) method which takes a expr_t parameter. It appears that this expr_t will modify a posting amount before it is added to the account total. However, it does not appear this would jive well with the way the account total is computed, that is, by updating a previously computed account total. So I believe this causes two issues:\r\n\r\n1. The `account_t::amount` method, when called with an expr argument, will not compute the entire account total based on expr. Only postings not included since the most recent call to `account_t::amount` will reflect expr. This could lead to unexpected results if a user makes use of the expr argument.\r\n2. The amount method could give unexpected results if a previous invocation of `account_t::amount` used the expr argument as some postings may be factored into the total with the old expr.\r\n\r\nIs this intended behavior? Or is there some safeguard to prevent this that I missed? It is difficult for me to know whether this is intended since I cannot find any call to `account_t::amount` that uses the expr argument.\r\n\r\nIf the current behavior is not intended, then I believe a fix would be relatively easy: whenever the expr argument exists, recompute the total from scratch and do not affect the totals stored in `xdata_-\u003eself_details`.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2023-07-14T02:58:51Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.287959-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2273"}

{"id":"ledger-1560","title":"Make \"reg\" output the account balance","description":"Currently it outputs the total balance, which usually adds up to zero at the end of each transaction. Instead, I want to output the cumulative balance of the given account at the time of the transaction, so that I can see how much money is in each account. Here is a Python script that does exactly that:\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nimport csv\r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\nfrom decimal import Decimal\r\n\r\naccounts = defaultdict(Decimal)\r\n\r\nos.system(\"ledger -f journal.txt csv \u003e x.csv\")\r\n\r\nprint(\"%10s  %20s  %25s  %10s  %10s\" % (\"Date\", \"Name\",\r\n    \"Account\", \"Amount\", \"Account Balance\"))\r\nwith open('x.csv', newline='') as csvfile:\r\n    for date, _, name, account, _, amount, _, _ in csv.reader(csvfile):\r\n        accounts[account] += Decimal(amount)\r\n        print(\"%10s  %20s  %25s  %10.2f  %10.2f\" % (date, name[:20],\r\n            account, Decimal(amount), accounts[account]))\r\n```\r\nIt works and does exactly what I wanted. Given how simple it is, would it make sense to implement this operation in ledger itself? Maybe it is already there, but I didn't figure out how to do it. If we add this feature, it seems something like `ledger -f journal.txt reg -T account_balance` would make sense.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2023-11-12T22:48:16Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.285043-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2297"}

{"id":"ledger-1579","title":"\u003ccctype\u003e abuse","description":"Various parts of ledger pass values of type char, derived from arbitrary user input, into the standard C++ \u003ccctype\u003e functions std::isspace, std::isalpha, \u0026c. (which are just copies of the standard C \u003cctype.h\u003e functions).  For example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ledger/ledger/blob/c679e3cbd5a44fa876c42b6912d9aa7729427c8f/src/textual.cc#L343\r\n\r\nHere `line[...]` has type char.\r\n\r\nThe ctype functions take inputs of type int.  But when the input to the \u003ccctype\u003e functions is not representable by type unsigned char -- that is, when the value represented by the object of type char is negative -- and the value is not the value of the integer constant macro EOF, this is undefined behaviour:\r\n\r\n\u003e The header \u003cctype.h\u003e declares several functions useful for classifying and mapping characters.  In all cases the argument is an int, the value of which shall be representable as an unsigned char or shall equal the value of the macro EOF.  If the argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e [_ISO C11, Sec. 7.4 Character handling \u003cctype.h\u003e_](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf#page=218)\r\n\r\nFor example, given `char x[2] = {0xa2,0}`, which represents a NUL-terminated string of POUND SIGN (£) in the locale en_GB.ISO8859-1, on platforms where char is signed such as [the usual amd64 ABI](http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf) and EOF is -1, `isspace(x[0])` is undefined behaviour because the value of `x[0]` is -94, which is neither the value of EOF nor representable by the type unsigned char.  (It can be _converted_ to unsigned char, giving the different number 162.)\r\n\r\nThe undefined behaviour may manifest as silent wrong answers, as in https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2338, or as crashes if the virtual page preceding a ctype table is mapped unreadable.  Even in cases where it is not undefined behaviour, the answer may be wrong.  For example, given `char x[2] = {0xff, 0}`, which might represent a NUL-terminated string of LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS (ÿ) in the locale fr_FR.ISO8859-1, `isalpha(x[0])` will return the same result as `isspace(EOF)` on most systems (where EOF is -1), giving false when the correct answer is true.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this peculiar interface is that the ctype functions were intended to handle the results of C functions like fgetc, or C++ functions like std::istream::peek, which return values of type int, which can be _either_ EOF (typically -1) _or_ a value that is representable in unsigned char (0, 1, 2, ..., 255):\r\n\r\n```\r\nstd::istream in = ...;\r\nint ch;\r\n\r\nwhile ((ch = in.peek()) != EOF) {\r\n  if (std::isspace(ch)) ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing them to process elements of a char array or std::string generally requires casting the char to unsigned char first:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstd::string s = ...;\r\n\r\nif (std::isspace(s[i])) { ... } // almost always wrong\r\nif (std::isspace(static_cast\u003cunsigned char\u003e(s[i]))) { ... } // guaranteed safe\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven in cases where an input of type char _might_ be guaranteed, by the surrounding context, to lie in the range {0, 1, 2, ..., 127} instead of {-128, -127, ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., 127}, it is (a) still safe to cast to unsigned char first, (b) easier to audit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(Some uses of the ctype macros might be inappropriate anyway to process UTF-8-encoded input (or possibly other multibyte input, if ledger supports that).  But, if that is an issue, it is a different issue that can be resolved separately.  This issue is just about the abuse of ctype functions for inputs of type char.)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2024-04-27T19:51:33Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.279167-08:00","closed_at":"2024-08-07T00:51:40Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2340"}

When the _lot price_ is `30.00` and _sale price_ is `50.00`.\r\n\r\n## Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe following transaction should be balanced.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2005-08-01 Stock sale\r\n    Assets:Broker                                -50 AAPL {30.00} @ 50.00\r\n    Expenses:Broker:Commissions                19.95\r\n    Income:Capital Gains                   -1,000.00\r\n    Assets:Broker                           2,480.05\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nLedger 3.3.2-20230330 says the transaction is not\tbalanced.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhile parsing file \"commodity-bug.ledger\", line 10:\r\nWhile balancing transaction from \"commodity-bug.ledger\", lines 6-10:\r\n\u003e 2005-08-01 Stock sale\r\n\u003e     Assets:Broker                                -50 AAPL {30.00} @ 50.00\r\n\u003e     Expenses:Broker:Commissions                19.95\r\n\u003e     Income:Capital Gains                   -1,000.00\r\n\u003e     Assets:Broker                           2,480.05\r\nUnbalanced remainder is:\r\n               -1000\r\nAmount to balance against:\r\n                2500\r\nError: Transaction does not balance\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears to be incorrectly using the _sale price_ as the _lot price_. Because the transaction would be balanced if using either:\r\n\r\n- `-50 AAPL @ 30.00` or\r\n- `-50 AAPL {30.00} @ 30.00`\r\n\r\nBut, of course, those are not the correct way to represent the sale posting. They do not correspond with how the posting is represented when explicit commodities are used, which is: _amount_ _stock_ `{` _lot price_ `}` `@` _sale price_.\r\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2024-06-28T03:22:01Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.277421-08:00","closed_at":"2024-06-28T03:36:58Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2353"}

The only missing piece is… time may not be considered a fungible commodity in ledger. What would it take to make it so?\n\nNow… I'm probably not using ledger-cli the way it's meant to be used; but consider this fictitious ledger\n\n```ledger\ni 2024/04/03 13:04:28  Projects:AAPL:Contract  Assets:Intagibles:Time\no 2024/04/03 19:12:53\n\ni 2024/03/28 08:13:00  Projects:AAPL:Contract  Assets:Intagibles:Time\no 2024/03/29 14:39:00\n\n2024-04-28 * Payee\n  Projects:AAPL:Contract   -22h\n  Assets:Checking         $1111\n```\n\n`bal` reports as should\n\n```\n                $1111  Assets:Checking\n               14.57h  Projects:AAPL:Contract\n --------------------\n                $1111\n               14.57h\n```\n\nSeeing this, the next thought that comes to mind is **What is the value of the hour?**\n\n`bal -X $` returns the same report as `bal`. `prices` and `pricedb` do nothing.\n\n_p.s: One workaround would be to use a commodity like \"hours\" — or \"seconds\", if one wants to be meticulous — in a journal without the timekeeping bits, and have the time unit work as a commodity. This is a find workaround. It would just be nice for ledger to consider time, as registered in timekeeping, a fungible commodity._\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-02-10T01:54:45Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.272984-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2407"}

For example:\n```\n2025-04-11 Coinbase\n    Assets:Coinbase                             -100 BTC {$100} @ $40\n    Assets:Coinbase                        $4,000.00\n    Expenses:Capital Loss                  $6,000.00\n```\n\nThis feature request would allow for two commodities, both priced in the same base commodity, to be \"swapped\", with a resulting gain/loss reflecting the discrepancy in value. This would allow the following to balance:\n```\n2025-04-12 Coinbase\n    Assets:Coinbase                             -100 BTC {$100} @ 20 ETH {$40}\n    Assets:Coinbase                            2,000 ETH {$40}\n    Expenses:Capital Loss                  $2,000.00\n```\n\nThis sort of \"commodity swap over a common base commodity price\" is a very regular occurence on crypto exchanges.

However, after analyzing it in depth, I realize that its business model is based on evading any responsibility for the use and protection of the product they sell. Furthermore, they lack adequate insurance to support their customers in critical situations.\n\nIf I were leading Ledger, I would implement a service liability system and parallel recovery protection for HD wallets. This would cover cases such as theft, duress, loss, natural disasters, or any other situation that justifies access to a legitimate backup.\n\nThe solution would not be a simple cloud backup, but a secure and decentralized protocol, perhaps using distributed Shamir backups, with activation under strict verification. Such a system would not only protect the average user, but would also mark a turning point in the industry, differentiating Ledger from the competition and facilitating mass adoption.\n\n Because financial sovereignty is key, but smart-backed security is what will truly build trust in the real world.\n#bitcoin #BTC #laev #sanramon #blockchain #SatoshiNakamoto #diana #hanbot #mirceapopescu #btc #ogsdebitcoin #carteldebitcoiners #blockchain Binance Otto Guevara Guth FBI Community Outreach Nayib Bukele Bitcoin Magazine YouTube","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-08-15T02:55:46Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.267879-08:00","closed_at":"2025-08-15T03:01:48Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2432"}

{"id":"ledger-1637","title":"[discussion] Trying to understand performance impact of --sort","description":"I have relatively large ledger database (30167 postings as of now) spread across multiple files.  Each file has the entries ordered by date, but the include at the end of each file makes it so that there are blocks of ordered entries\n\n```\n2014\n2015\n...\n2024\n2025\n\u003cinclude\u003e\n2014\n2015\n2016\n...\n```\n\nSo that reports like `ledger reg` are ordered then suddenly jump back 10 years.  I split my files per bank/broker and other kinda complicated ways, but that's besides the point (😅)\n\nObvious and correct solution here is to use `--sort date` and so I figured I could place that in the `.ledgerrc`.  Now I'm trying to understand the performance impact of this, because I don't *always* need to sort, and now only add it when necessary.  But it seems to me that there is virtually no impact:\n\nreg with sort and without\n\n```\n[21:19:42]matus@parmenides:~\n\u003e time ledger reg --sort date \u003e/dev/null\n\n________________________________________________________\nExecuted in  132.77 secs    fish           external\n   usr time  130.60 secs  359.00 micros  130.60 secs\n   sys time    2.16 secs   57.00 micros    2.16 secs\n\n[21:21:57]matus@parmenides:~\n\u003e time ledger reg \u003e/dev/null\n\n________________________________________________________\nExecuted in  135.87 secs    fish           external\n   usr time  133.50 secs  380.00 micros  133.50 secs\n   sys time    2.11 secs   64.00 micros    2.11 secs\n```\n\nbal with sort and without\n\n\n```\n[21:19:35]matus@parmenides:~\n\u003e time ledger bal --sort date \u003e/dev/null\n\n________________________________________________________\nExecuted in    3.40 secs    fish           external\n   usr time    3.38 secs  366.00 micros    3.38 secs\n   sys time    0.02 secs   65.00 micros    0.02 secs\n\n[21:19:11]matus@parmenides:~\n\u003e time ledger bal \u003e/dev/null\n\n________________________________________________________\nExecuted in    3.37 secs    fish           external\n   usr time    3.34 secs  380.00 micros    3.34 secs\n   sys time    0.03 secs   98.00 micros    0.03 secs\n```\n\nHow is this possible?  I was under the impression that ledger processes the entries as it parses them, while using `--sort` implies ledger first has to read everything and then process it.  So I guess the time spent parsing is actually completely negligible?  If so would it make sense to even make `--sort` on by default?  I believe beancount behaves like that.\n\nThanks!","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-10T20:32:47Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.263826-08:00","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2495"}

{"id":"ledger-1639","title":"Register and unregister automatic transaction","description":"I'm budgeting using automatic transactions and I'm using a lot of time ranges for things which changed in time.  For example, my pension payment (tax) depends on my income.  As my income increases with my career progress, I must adjust my budget, but I also want to keep historical budget information.\n\nSo I end up with something like this (numbers and accounts edited for privacy)\n\n```\n;; Taxes and insurance\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2019/01/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2019/06/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1000\n    [Budget]                                  -$1000\n\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2019/06/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2020/04/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1100\n    [Budget]                                  -$1100\n\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2020/04/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2020/10/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1200\n    [Budget]                                  -$1200\n\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2020/10/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2022/03/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1300\n    [Budget]                                  -$1300\n\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2022/03/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2023/06/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1400\n    [Budget]                                  -$1400\n\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2023/06/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2024/06/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1500\n    [Budget]                                  -$1500\n\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2024/06/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2025/05/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1600\n    [Budget]                                  -$1600\n\n= /^Budget:Trigger$/ \u0026 expr 'date \u003e= [2025/05/01] \u0026 date \u003c [2029/05/01]'\n    [Budget:Expenses:State:Pension]            $1700\n    [Budget]                                  -$1700\n```\n\nNow this creates 8 automatic transactions which have to be checked against all the postings, including the ones which are not related at all.  I was doing some testing and this creates *massive* performance loss. One of these takes about 0.15 seconds on my ledger which seems small but with 100 auto transactions that's 15 seconds for every report.\n\nMy idea is to give each automated transaction some name and an ability to unregister it later in the file, so that I can \"bracket\" those time periods in my input file and only run one query on each period instead of 8 (7 of which will return false always).\n\nI would need to check how feasible this is implementation wise, but I don't see in principle a reason this won't be possible.\n\nIt would also allow you to add automated transactions only to specific files, for example your broker transactions to calculate some portfolio related stuff and at the end of the file you can unregister the transactions.

However, if I reverse the order and put `-f checking.journal` second, it segfaults, but not before printing some errors about unknown tags. The original command line printed no output.\n\n## Potential cause and solution\n\n*Important disclaimer: I don't know anything about C++.*  After applying the patch below, the same command line didn't segfault anymore. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to run the project's tests to make sure the change didn't break anything. If I knew anything about C++, I'd submit a pull request instead of just this issue.\n\n---\n\nI don't know anything about C++, but ChatGPT seems to think it does, so I pulled the source code from git and asked it to find a fix. It suggested that `register_metadata` was emitting a warning and dereferencing `current_context`:\n\n\u003e Root cause looks like a dangling `journal.current_context` during CSV convert: when the extra `posting_type` column is treated as unknown metadata, `register_metadata` emits a warning and dereferences `current_context`, which still points to a parse context that was popped earlier. With no extra column, that warning path isn’t hit, so no crash. I wired `convert` to set/restore the current parse context so warnings and metadata checks are safe.\n\u003e\n\u003e Changes applied:\n\u003e - Set context.scope for convert and guard journal.current_context while CSV parsing runs in convert.cc.\n\nThis is a patch I created based on Codex's output:\n\n```patch\ndiff --git a/src/convert.cc b/src/convert.cc\nindex aee1be44..04d138da 100644\n--- a/src/convert.cc\n+++ b/src/convert.cc\n@@ -67,6 +67,17 @@ value_t convert_command(call_scope_t\u0026 args) {\n   parse_context_t\u0026 context(report.session.parsing_context.get_current());\n   context.journal = \u0026journal;\n   context.master = bucket;\n+  context.scope = \u0026report.session;\n+\n+  struct current_context_guard {\n+    journal_t\u0026 journal;\n+    parse_context_t* saved;\n+    current_context_guard(journal_t\u0026 j, parse_context_t* current)\n+        : journal(j), saved(j.current_context) {\n+      journal.current_context = current;\n+    }\n+    ~current_context_guard() { journal.current_context = saved; }\n+  } guard(journal, \u0026context);\n \n   csv_reader reader(context);\n```\n\nI hope that helps!","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T05:23:47Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.262512-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T18:24:29Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2521"}

However, I haven't found a way to get ledger to _accept_ dates in this format as input.\n\nFor instance, a ledger file looking like this:\n\n```\n2011/10/01 4b4e2a89 \n    ef9d9585:efa1fb7b:22845e93:0e3763f0       2,00 A\n    2c166ff7:d34e3aa1:8a5075b3:56f3c726\n\n2011/10/01 15983995\n    eb78b6c0:a2857de3:d6d8ea07:6688fc4e       2,58 A\n    ba3ffe56:c3ba36a5:aa63399f:e9e1d043\n```\n\nresults in this output from `ledger print`:\n\n```\n01.10.2011 4b4e2a89 \n    ef9d9585:efa1fb7b:22845e93:0e3763f0       2,00 A\n    2c166ff7:d34e3aa1:8a5075b3:56f3c726\n\n01.10.2011 15983995\n    eb78b6c0:a2857de3:d6d8ea07:6688fc4e       2,58 A\n    ba3ffe56:c3ba36a5:aa63399f:e9e1d043\n```\n\nPutting this exact output back into ledger results in:\n\n```\n$ ledger -f test.ledger bal\nWhile parsing file \"test.ledger\", line 1: \nWhile parsing transaction:\n\u003e 01.10.2011 15983995\nError: Invalid date: 01.10.2011\nWhile parsing file \"test.ledger\", line 5: \nWhile parsing transaction:\n\u003e 01.10.2011 15983995\nError: Invalid date: 01.10.2011\n```\n\nUsing the (undocumented) option \"--input-date-format=%d.%m.%Y\" yields the same result.\n\nI'm using Ledger 3.0.0-20110325 from the Ubuntu PPA repository Michael Budde created (https://launchpad.net/~mbudde/+archive/ledger) under Ubuntu 11.10. I'd be very grateful for any pointers!\n\nCheers,\n\nJonas\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2011-12-06T20:45:18Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.467487-08:00","closed_at":"2011-12-07T08:46:00Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/48"}

{"id":"ledger-70","title":"automated transactions processing out of order?","description":"This is a bug report for Ledger 3.0.0-20130529. It's hard to describe, so I will use an example that hopefully you can reproduce.\n\nSay I'm using a payment processor for all my sales, and they charge 3%. Let's automate that.\n\n```\n= sales\n    expenses:payment processing         (-amount * 0.03)\n    accounts:receivable                 (amount * 0.03)\n```\n\nSomeone buys the product.\n\n```\n2013/01/07 * mycustomer\n    sales:myproduct                 -100 USD\n    accounts:receivable\n```\n\nThe automation will turn this into: \n\n```\nsales:myproduct             -100.00 USD\naccounts:receivable         100.00 USD\nexpenses:payment processing 3.00 USD\naccounts:receivable         -3.00 USD\n```\n\nSo far so good. Anyway, finally I get my money back from the payment processor:\n\n```\n2013/01/09 * Processor\n    accounts:receivable \n    accounts:checking               97.00 USD\n```\n\nThis works perfectly. If I run a balance then `accounts:receivable` will balance to 0: first they owed me some money, but they paid it in full.\n\nHowever, if I change that last transaction to this: \n\n```\n2013/01/09 * Processor\n    accounts:receivable             = 0 USD\n    accounts:checking               97.00 USD\n```\n\n... then things suddenly don't balance anymore: \"Error: Balance assertion off by -3.00 USD.\" So apparently at that point in Ledger's processing `accounts:receivable` is still at 100 USD, even though after automated processing it's 97.00 USD. This is doubly strange to me since the automated processing happens at the point of the _sale_, the payment by the processor is a transaction that's entirely manually specified.\n\nLet's try something else. What if we leave the other side blank:\n\n```\n2013/01/09 * Processor\n    accounts:receivable             = 0 USD\n    accounts:checking               \n```\n\nWell, then if we do a balance it'll say accounts:receivable is at `-3.00 USD`, not exactly what `= 0 USD` is supposed to do.\n\nMy guess is that automated transactions aren't processed as early as they should be.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2013-07-19T17:24:48Z","updated_at":"2026-02-07T23:49:28.421651-08:00","closed_at":"2013-07-19T20:00:06Z","external_ref":"https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/203"}

I am trying to track my starbucks points. Sometimes points are earned through spending, and sometimes there are bonus points. My plan was to use automatic transactions for stars earned through spending and then just set the balance to zero (or whatever the balance is after redeeming) when the points are redeemed. Here is the test journal I have put together.\r\n\r\n```\r\n; -*- ledger -*-\r\n\r\naccount Awards:Starbucks:Earned\r\naccount Awards:Starbucks:Balance\r\naccount Awards:Starbucks:Redeemed\r\n\r\ncommodity $\r\n    note United States Dollars\r\n    format $1,000.00\r\n    nomarket\r\n    default\r\n   \r\n= @/^Starbucks/ and /Coffee/\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Earned                              (-0.5 SB * amount)\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Balance                             ( 0.5 SB * amount)\r\n\r\n2017-01-01 * Starbucks (Card Reloaded)\r\n    Expenses:Coffee                                      50.00 USD\r\n    Liabilities:Cash                                       \r\n\r\n2017-01-03 * Starbucks (Stars Redeemed)\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Earned                                -95 SB   ; ## Ultimately I want this auto calculated. ##\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Redeemed                             8.00 USD @@ 120.00 SB\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Balance\r\n```\r\n\r\nat this point this command give me the following (accurate) balance: $ ledger -f .\\Awards.dat -w bal awards -V --empty --flat\r\n\r\n                   0  Awards:Starbucks:Balance\r\n           -120.0 SB  Awards:Starbucks:Earned\r\n            120.0 SB  Awards:Starbucks:Redeemed\r\n\r\nwhen I change the last transaction to \r\n\r\n```\r\n2017-01-03 * Starbucks (Stars Redeemed)\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Redeemed                             8.00 USD @@ 120.00 SB\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Balance    \r\n```                          \r\n\r\nand add \r\n\r\n```\r\n2017-01-03 * Starbucks (Stars Redeemed)\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Earned\r\n    Awards:Starbucks:Balance                             = 0 SB \r\n\r\n```\r\nI get the following balance:\r\n```\r\n\r\n$ ledger -f .\\Awards.dat -w bal awards -V --empty --flat\r\n             25.0 SB  Awards:Starbucks:Balance\r\n           -145.0 SB  Awards:Starbucks:Earned\r\n            120.0 SB  Awards:Starbucks:Redeemed\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe question I have is why isn't Awards:Starbucks:Balance = 0 SB?  Isn't that what the balance assertion is supposed to insure?
