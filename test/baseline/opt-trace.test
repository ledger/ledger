; Using values with two or more digits as the argument to the --trace option
; resulted in a segmentation fault.
; Since ledger prints debugging information to stderr when the --trace option
; was given and that debugging information contains timing information, e.g. [1ms]
; which is likely to differ on each test run, this test only checks that ledger
; does not crash when the --trace options was specified.
