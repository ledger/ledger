; Test for issue #1784 - Stock split with lot notation
;
; This test documents the correct way to record stock splits using lot notation.
; In a stock split, the total cost basis must be preserved - the per-share cost
; changes inversely to the split ratio.
;
; Example: 4:1 split of 7 shares at 40 EUR each
; - Before: 7 shares at 40 EUR = 280 EUR total cost basis
; - After: 28 shares at 10 EUR = 280 EUR total cost basis (40 / 4 = 10)
;
; IMPORTANT: The cost basis per share must be DIVIDED by the split ratio,
; not multiplied. Using {160.00 EUR} (40 * 4) instead of {10.00 EUR} (40 / 4)
; is a user error and will correctly fail with "Transaction does not balance".
