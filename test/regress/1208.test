; Test for issue #1208: ledger xact should not output trailing newline
; after the last posting. This allows tools like ledger-add-transaction
; to append output without creating unnecessary blank lines.
;
; Prior to the fix, print_xact would output a trailing newline after the
; last posting. When Emacs ledger-add-transaction appended this output
; to a file and added its own newline, it would create an unwanted blank line.
