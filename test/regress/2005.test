; Test that --permissive suppresses balance assertion errors when an
; elided (auto-computed) amount is combined with a balance assignment.
; Without --permissive, the balance assignment sets Assets:Checking to
; $12345, making the transaction unbalanced ($3141 + $12345 = $15486).
; With --permissive, the balance assignment is skipped and the elided
; amount is auto-computed as -$3141 to balance the transaction.
