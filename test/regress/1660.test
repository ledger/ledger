; Regression test for issue #1660: !include should be case-sensitive.
; Including a filename with wrong case (1660.DAT vs 1660.dat) must fail
; on case-sensitive filesystems and should not silently match a
; differently-cased file via the glob matching logic.

include 1660.DAT

test bal -> 1
__ERROR__
While parsing file "$FILE", line 6:
Error: File to include was not found: "$sourcepath/test/regress/1660.DAT"
