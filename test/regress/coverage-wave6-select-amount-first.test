; amount as first and only column - thus_far is empty at line 321
; so formatter uses -1 for the column start position
test select amount --columns 80
      $50.00
     $-50.00
end test

; total as first, then amount - exercises thus_far accumulation (line 266)
test select total, amount --columns 80
      $50.00       $50.00
           0      $-50.00
end test
