; Regression test for GitHub issue #1196: Fixed commodity treated as separate
; commodity. When using a fixed lot price {=price}, the annotated commodity
; should not appear as a distinct commodity from the base one. The running
; total in reg and bal reports should combine amounts of the same base
; commodity regardless of their lot price annotations.
