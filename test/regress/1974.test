; Regression test for issue #1974
; The print command was incorrectly omitting amounts for unbalanced virtual
; postings when a transaction had exactly two postings of the same commodity.
; The 2-posting amount elision optimization only applies when both postings
; must balance; unbalanced virtual postings like (A) and (B) must always
; have their amounts printed explicitly.
