; Regression test for GitHub issue #2105:
; Real postings and balanced-virtual postings ([Account]) must balance
; independently.  A real posting and a balanced-virtual posting with opposite
; amounts must NOT cancel each other out and silently pass the balance check.

2024/08/11 Example
    Income                                     $1.00
    [Expenses]                                $-1.00
