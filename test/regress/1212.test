; Regression test for issue #1212:
; "print --generated output unparsable with multiple commodities"
;
; When a transaction uses multiple commodities (e.g., USD and EUR) without an
; explicit cost, ledger automatically computes a lot price annotation. The
; print command with --generated should output this annotation with a date in
; YYYY/MM/DD format (parseable) rather than YY-Mon-DD format (unparseable).
;
; The bug was that `print --generated` produced output like:
;   Foo  10.00 USD {1.10 EUR} [00-Jan-01]
; which could not be parsed back by ledger due to the invalid date format.
; The fix ensures the date is written in the standard YYYY/MM/DD format.

2000/01/01
    Foo  10.00 USD
    Bar  -11.00 EUR

test print --generated -> 0
2000/01/01 <Unspecified payee>
    Foo                                 10.00 USD {1.10 EUR} [2000/01/01]
    Bar                                   -11.00 EUR
end test
