; Regression test for GitHub issue #1009
; ledger crashes with "Exception during initialization:
; boost::filesystem::current_path: No such file or directory"
; when run from a non-existent (deleted) directory.
;
; The fix adds safe_current_path() which catches the error_code from
; boost::filesystem::current_path() and falls back to "/" when the
; current working directory is unavailable (e.g., deleted or a
; disconnected FUSE mount).
