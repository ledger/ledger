; Regression test for issue #964
; Balance report with lot-priced multi-currency transaction and -X conversion
;
; A transaction involving currency lots with differing cost basis and
; current price should not produce spurious Equity:Capital Gains entries
; in the balance report, and the total should balance to zero.
;
; The original bug showed:
;   $6.45  Equity:Capital Gains  (spurious entry)
;   $6.46  total (incorrect, did not balance)
;
; After the fix (also resolves #712), no Equity:Capital Gains is generated
; automatically, and the balance correctly sums to zero.
