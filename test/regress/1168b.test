; Regression test for issue #1168 (alternative form)
; An explicit zero amount with a balance assertion ($0 = $100) should pass
; without error even when the current balance matches.
;
; Eric Portis noted: "Assets:Bank account  $0 = $100" lets you balance the
; whole folder but the assertion fails when you try to balance the statement
; by itself (as expected).  The main form "= $100" (balance assignment) should
; succeed in both the individual and combined-file cases.
