# Test case from issue #2413
# The xact command should use the last year directive (2025) when creating
# a new transaction with a partial date like "03-03"
#
# This test reproduces the exact examples from the issue report:
# https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2413

# First example from the issue: multiple year directives
