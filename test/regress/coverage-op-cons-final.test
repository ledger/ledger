; Coverage test for op.cc: calc_cons else branch (non-O_CONS right)
; Exercises: calc_cons else branch (lines 529-531) when right node
;   is not O_CONS (final element of cons chain)

; Two-element cons expression: right is VALUE, not O_CONS
test eval "1, 2"
(1, 2)
end test

; Three-element cons: right is O_CONS with right being VALUE
test eval "1, 2, 3"
(1, 2, 3)
end test

; Cons with expressions
test eval "2 + 3, 4 * 5, 6 - 1"
(5, 20, 5)
end test
