; Regression test for GitHub issue #992
; Transactions with fixated lot prices ({=$price}) without explicit @ conversion
; should balance the same way as when @ $price is specified explicitly.
;
; Previously, using {=$price} without @ would fail to balance even when the
; amounts matched within display precision. This was because the 2-commodity
; handler would incorrectly compute an average rate instead of using the
; individual fixated prices.
