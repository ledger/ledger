; Let's say the second purchase attracts an equalisation of 2.00 GBP.
; This means that the purchase price from now on should be 18.00
; rather than 20.00 GBP.  So we add a new share with that price and
; the original date, and remove the existing share at the old price; the
; difference of 2.00 GBP is the equalisation received, which is paid to
; the account.
