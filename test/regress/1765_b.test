; Regression test for GitHub issue #1765 (part b):
; When the per-unit cost does NOT round to the posted amount at the commodity
; display precision, bal --basis reveals the imbalance explicitly.
;
; 0.5 A @ $5.430 produces a cost of $2.715.  With $ at 2dp, rounded($2.715)
; = $2.72 (round half away from zero), not $2.71.  The --basis report
; shows the imbalance as $0.01 rather than hiding the fractional remainder.
