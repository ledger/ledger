# Ledger: Command-Line Accounting

Ledger is a powerful, double-entry accounting system that is accessed from the
UNIX command-line.  This may put off some users, since there is no flashy UI,
but for those who want unparalleled reporting access to their data there are
few alternatives.

Ledger uses text files for input.  It reads the files and generates reports;
there is no other database or stored state.  To use Ledger, you create a
file of your account names and transactions, run from the command line with
some options to specify input and requested reports, and get output.
The output is generally plain text, though you could generate a graph or
html instead.  Ledger is simple in concept, surprisingly rich in ability,
and easy to use.


## For the Impatient

I know, you just want to build and play.  If you have all the dependencies
installed (see below), then simply do this:

    git clone git://github.com/ledger/ledger.git
    cd ledger && ./acprep update  # Update to the latest, configure, make

Now try your first ledger command:

    ./ledger -f test/input/sample.dat reg

For help on keeping your journal have a look at the
[documentation](http://www.ledger-cli.org/docs.html) and the
[wiki](http://wiki.ledger-cli.org/) (Also see the “Resources” section at the
end of this file). An emacs mode for ledger files can be found in the `lisp`
directory and a vim plugin is located in the [ledger/vim-ledger
repository](https://github.com/ledger/vim-ledger).

## To the Rest

If you're reading this file, you have in your hands the Bleeding Edge.  This
may very well *not* be what you want, since it's not guaranteed to be in a
functionally complete state.  It's under active development, and may change in
any way at any time.

What you may prefer is the current stable release, or the current beta branch.
The **BETA** is what I prefer people use, since I still have a chance to fix
major bugs that you find.  Just e-mail me, or post to the mailing list,
they'll become a part of my work list.

<table>
<tr><td><strong>RELEASE</strong></td><td><tt>git checkout v3.1</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CURRENT</strong></td><td><tt>git checkout maint</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>BETA</strong></td><td><tt>git checkout -b master origin/master</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ALPHA</strong></td><td><tt>git checkout -b next origin/next</tt></td></tr>
</table>

There are also several topic branches which contain experimental features,
though none of these are guaranteed to compile.  Best to chat with me on
[IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/ledger) or via the
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ledger-cli) before going too
much further with those.

## Dependencies

If you wish to proceed in this venture, you'll need a few dependencies.  The
easiest way to get them for your platform is to run this handy Python
script:

    ./acprep dependencies

If that doesn't completely work, here are the dependencies for building the
current `master` branch:

<table>
<tr><td>Boost</td><td>1.35</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>GMP</td><td>4.2.2</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>MPFR</td><td>2.4.0</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>utfcpp</td><td>2.3.4</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>gettext</td><td>0.17</td><td><em>optional</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>libedit</td><td>20090111-3.0</td><td><em>optional</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Python</td><td>2.4</td><td><em>optional</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>doxygen</td><td>1.5.7.1</td><td><em>optional</em>, for <tt>make docs</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>graphviz</td><td>2.20.3</td><td><em>optional</em>, for <tt>make docs</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>texinfo</td><td>4.13</td><td><em>optional</em>, for <tt>make docs</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>lcov</td><td>1.6</td><td><em>optional</em>, for <tt>make report</tt>, used with <tt>/./acprep gcov</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>sloccount</td><td>2.26</td><td><em>optional</em>, for <tt>make sloc</tt></td></tr>
</table>

And for building the current `maint` branch:

<table>
<tr><td>GMP</td><td>4.2.2</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>pcre</td><td>7.7</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>libofx</td><td>0.8.3</td><td><em>optional</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>expat</td><td>2.0.1</td><td><em>optional</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>libxml2</td><td>2.7.2</td><td><em>optional</em></td></tr>
</table>

### OS X

You can use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) or [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install this very quickly on OS X. 

#### 1. Homebrew

You can see the parameters you can pass while installing with brew by the command `brew options ledger`. To install ledger, simply type the following command:

    brew install ledger
    
If everything worked well, you should have ledger working now. If you want to install this with python bindings, you can use the following command:

    brew install ledger --with-python

If you to want to startup python, use the following command:

    ledger python


#### 2. MacPorts

If you build stuff using MacPorts on OS X, as I do, here is what you would
run:

    sudo port install -f cmake python26 \
         libiconv +universal zlib +universal gmp +universal \
         mpfr +universal ncurses +universal ncursesw +universal \
         gettext +universal libedit +universal boost-jam \
         boost +st+python26+icu texlive doxygen graphviz \
         texinfo lcov sloccount

### Ubuntu

If you're going to build on Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install ...` the
following packages (current as of Ubuntu 14.04):

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake doxygen \
         libboost-system-dev libboost-dev python-dev gettext git \
         libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
         libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-regex-dev \
         libboost-test-dev libedit-dev libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo

Or, for Ubuntu 12.04:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
         python-dev gettext libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libboost-dev \
         libboost-regex-dev libboost-date-time-dev \
         libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-python-dev texinfo lcov \
         sloccount libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-test-dev

### Debian

Debian squeeze (6.0): the version of boost in squeeze is too old
for ledger and unfortunately no backport is available at the moment.

Debian 7 (wheezy) and Debian 8 (jessie) contain all components needed to
build ledger.  You can install all required build dependencies using the
following command:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake autopoint texinfo python-dev \
         zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libgmp3-dev gettext libmpfr-dev \
         libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
         libboost-graph-dev libboost-iostreams-dev \
         libboost-python-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-test-dev

## Building

The next step is preparing your environment for building.  While you can use
`cmake .` and make, I've prepared a script that does a lot more of the
footwork for you:

    ./acprep update
    # or, if you want to use the Boost libraries with suffix -mt, install in
    # $HOME/local and build with 2 processes in parallel
    ./acprep update --boost-suffix=-mt --prefix=$HOME/local -j2

See the `help` subcommand to `acprep`, which explains some of its many options.
It's pretty much the only command I run for configuring, building and testing
Ledger.

You can run `make check` to confirm the result, and `make install` to install.

## Resources

Now that you're up and running, here are a few resources to keep in mind:

 - [Home page](http://ledger-cli.org)
 - [Documentation](http://www.ledger-cli.org/docs.html)
 - [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/ledger)
 - [Mailing List / Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/ledger-cli)
 - [GitHub project page](http://github.com/ledger/ledger)
 - [Ohloh code analysis](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/ledger)

If you have ideas you'd like to share, the best way is either to e-mail me a
patch (I prefer attachments over pasted text), or to get an account on GitHub.
Once you do, fork the [Ledger project](http://github.com/ledger/ledger),
hack as much as you like, then send me a pull request via GitHub.
