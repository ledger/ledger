The problem is that CMake is trying to install `ledger.so` (a Python binding) into the Nix store's Python site-packages directory, but the Nix store is read-only during the build phase.\n\n\nThe core issue is that the CMake install rules are hardcoded to write to the Python dependency's site-packages directory in the Nix store, which is immutable. I need to look at the Nix derivation to see how the build is configured and adjust the install paths to use the proper output directory instead. the medium skill, then explore the relevant files.\n\nActually, wait - looking at the command more carefully, this is the `/medium` skill being invoked. Let me read the skill content first.\n\nThe `/medium` skill says \"Remember the following:\" which seems to be a prompt template for remembering things.

Follow these protocols\nthroughout the session to make full use of them.\n\n## 1. Claude-mem (Persistent Memory)\n\nClaude-mem provides semantic memory across sessions via MCP tools. A context\nindex is delivered automatically at session start in a system reminder.\n\n### Protocol: Search Before Re-Investigating\n\nBefore reading files or exploring code to understand something, **check memory\nfirst**. Past sessions likely already recorded the answer.\n\n```\n1. search(query) -> scan the index for relevant observation IDs\n2. timeline(anchor=ID) -> get surrounding context\n3. get_observations([IDs]) -> fetch full details only for filtered IDs\n```\n\nNever fetch full details without filtering first. The 3-layer workflow provides\n10x token savings.\n\n### Protocol: Save After Significant Work\n\nAfter completing any of the following, call `save_memory` to record it:\n\n- **Discoveries**: codebase structure, how a system works, where key code lives\n- **Decisions**: architectural choices, approach trade-offs, why option A over B\n- **Completed work**: what was built/changed, the final state, key details\n- **Bug findings**: root cause, fix applied, symptoms vs actual problem\n- **Learnings**: gotchas, undocumented behavior, things that surprised you\n\nWrite memory entries as self-contained observations. Future sessions will see\nthe title and token cost in the context index, then decide whether to fetch\nthe full record. A good title and enough detail to be useful standalone are\nkey.\n\n### Protocol: Use the Context Index\n\nThe session-start context index shows past observations with:\n- ID, timestamp, type (bugfix/feature/decision/discovery/etc.)\n- Title, token cost to read, tokens of work that produced it\n- File associations\n\nTrust this index for past decisions and learnings. Only fetch full observations\nwhen you need implementation details, rationale, or debugging context. Critical\ntypes (bugfix, decision) often merit detailed fetching.\n\n### Skills: /claude-mem:make-plan and /claude-mem:do\n\nThese skills create implementation plans with documentation discovery and\nexecute plans using subagents. Use them for structured multi-step work.\n\n## 2. git-ai-search (Conversation Context from Git)\n\ngit-ai tracks AI-generated code and the conversations that produced it.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- **Resuming work on a git repo**: Search for AI context on recent commits to\n  understand what was done and why\n- **Investigating unfamiliar code**: Check if AI sessions contributed to specific\n  files or line ranges\n- **Picking up a teammate's work**: Restore their conversation context\n- **PR reviews**: Understand AI involvement in changes\n\n### Key Commands\n\n```bash\ngit-ai search --commit <sha>              # AI context for a commit\ngit-ai search --file <path> --lines 50-75 # AI context for specific lines\ngit-ai search --pattern \"keyword\"         # Search prompt content\ngit-ai continue --commit <sha>            # Restore session context\n```\n\nUse `/git-ai-search` to invoke the full skill when deeper investigation is\nneeded.\n\n## 3. Cozempic (Context Weight Management)\n\nCozempic prevents context bloat, which causes degraded performance and lost\nstate (especially agent teams).\n\n### Automatic Protection\n\nThe Cozempic guard daemon starts automatically at session init. It monitors\nsession size and can auto-prune before compaction kills agent teams.\n\n### When to Use Proactively\n\n- **Long sessions**: When you've been working for a while and context feels\n  heavy, run `/cozempic diagnose` to check\n- **Before agent teams**: Ensure guard mode is active before spawning teams\n  with TeamCreate. Agent team state is lost when auto-compaction triggers.\n- **After large file reads**: If you've read many large files, context may be\n  bloated with stale content\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n| Situation | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Check session size | `cozempic current` |\n| Diagnose bloat | `/cozempic diagnose` |\n| Prune and reload | `/cozempic treat` |\n| Protect agent teams | Guard daemon (auto-started) |\n\n### Prescriptions\n\n- **gentle** (under 5MB): progress collapse, file dedup, metadata strip\n- **standard** (5-20MB): + thinking blocks, tool trim, stale reads\n- **aggressive** (over 20MB): + error collapse, document dedup, mega-block trim\n\n## 4. PAL MCP (Multi-Model Collaboration)\n\nPAL provides access to external models for second opinions, deep analysis, and\nconsensus building.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- **Complex debugging**: `mcp__pal__debug` for systematic root cause analysis\n- **Architecture decisions**: `mcp__pal__consensus` to consult multiple models\n- **Code review**: `mcp__pal__codereview` for structured review with expert\n  validation\n- **Before commits**: `mcp__pal__precommit` to validate changes\n- **Deep analysis**: `mcp__pal__thinkdeep` for multi-step investigation\n\n### Protocol: Choose the Right Tool\n\n| Need | PAL Tool |\n|------|----------|\n| Second opinion on approach | `chat` |\n| Systematic debugging | `debug` |\n| Architecture/code analysis | `analyze` |\n| Multi-model decision making | `consensus` |\n| Code review | `codereview` |\n| Pre-commit validation | `precommit` |\n| Security audit | `secaudit` |\n| Refactoring opportunities | `refactor` |\n| Test generation | `testgen` |\n\n## 5. Session Workflow Summary\n\n### At Session Start\n\n1. Read the Claude-mem context index (delivered automatically)\n2. If resuming work in a git repo, consider `git-ai search` on recent commits\n3. Search Claude-mem for relevant past work before starting new investigation\n\n### During Work\n\n1. Search memory before re-reading files or re-exploring code\n2. Save significant findings, decisions, and completions to memory\n3. Use PAL tools for complex analysis, debugging, and decisions\n4. Monitor context health; use Cozempic if sessions run long\n\n### Before Agent Teams\n\n1. Verify Cozempic guard is running (check session-start logs)\n2. If not running: `cozempic guard --threshold 50 -rx standard --interval 30`\n\n### At Session End\n\n1. Save any unsaved important findings to Claude-mem\n2. For git repos, work will be captured by git-ai automatically on commit\n",

The `flake.nix` `prePatch` was searching for the old literal string, couldn't find it, silently did nothing, and the install proceeded to try writing to the read-only Nix store Python path.\n\n**Summary of the fix:**\n\n- **Root cause**: Commit `66ccfaac` added `LEDGER_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` as a CMake cache variable, changing the CMakeLists.txt from `DESTINATION ${Pyth********ARCH}` to `DESTINATION \"${LEDGER_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR}\"`. The `flake.nix` `prePatch` used `substituteInPlace` to patch the old literal — that string no longer exists, so the patch silently no-ops, and the build tries to install into the read-only Python store path.\n\n- **Fix**: Removed the `prePatch` and instead pass `-DLEDGER_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=...` in `cmakeFlags`. This is exactly what the new variable was designed for (the commit message explicitly says \"Packagers can now pass `-DLEDGER_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`\"). The Python module will now install into the `py` output's `site-packages`, which is correct for Nix.",

Both builds happen in the **same job** on the same runner:\n\n1. **PR branch** is checked out, built into `build-pr/`, and benchmarked → `pr_results.json`\n2. The job then checks out the **merge base** (`github.event.pull_request.base.sha`), builds it into `build-base/`, and benchmarks it → `base_results.json`\n3. `compare_benchmarks.py` compares the two JSON files in the same step\n\nSince both binaries are built and benchmarked sequentially on the same runner instance, the hardware conditions are as consistent as they can be. The use of 15 runs with hyperfine also helps smooth out any transient noise.\n\nOne thing worth noting: the PR branch is benchmarked **first**, then the base. If the machine has any warm-up effect (CPU frequency scaling, thermal state), the base branch could see slightly better cache/thermal conditions. Swapping the order (base first, PR second) or interleaving runs would be more rigorous, but for a 2% threshold it's unlikely to matter in practice.",
