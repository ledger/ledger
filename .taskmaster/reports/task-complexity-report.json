			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Fix trait implementations for core types",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down trait implementation fixes into: 1) Implement Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq for Amount struct in ledger-math, 2) Implement ordering traits (PartialOrd, Ord) for Amount, 3) Implement arithmetic traits (Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Neg) for Amount with proper error handling, 4) Implement similar trait sets for Balance type, 5) Add trait implementations for Commodity and CommodityRef types, 6) Implement conversion traits between Decimal and BigRational, 7) Add Display and FromStr traits for user-facing formatting, 8) Create comprehensive unit tests for all trait implementations. Focus on proper BigRational wrapping and ensuring arithmetic operations preserve precision.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing ~15 different traits across 4-5 core types (Amount, Balance, Commodity, etc.) with 121 E0277 errors to fix. The complexity comes from ensuring proper BigRational arithmetic, handling commodity mismatches, and maintaining precision. Each trait needs careful implementation with error handling and extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Fix method resolution and missing methods",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize method implementations by type: 1) Implement explicit clone() methods where derive fails (particularly for types with BigRational), 2) Add comparison methods (eq, ne, lt, gt, le, ge) for Amount with proper commodity handling, 3) Implement arithmetic methods (add, sub, mul, div, neg) with Result types for error handling, 4) Add conversion methods between numeric types (to_decimal, from_decimal, to_rational, from_rational), 5) Implement utility methods like is_zero, abs, round, truncate for Amount/Balance, 6) Add builder pattern methods and method chaining support. Focus on the 84 E0599 errors systematically.",
			"reasoning": "With 84 E0599 errors indicating missing methods, this task involves implementing ~20-30 methods across multiple types. The work is more straightforward than trait implementations but requires careful attention to method signatures, error handling, and ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Resolve type system and lifetime issues",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Address type and lifetime issues systematically: 1) Add lifetime parameters to Account struct and implement proper reference cycle prevention with Rc/WeakRef, 2) Fix lifetime annotations in Posting struct for account references, 3) Resolve generic parameter bounds in parser modules (parser.rs, transaction_parser.rs), 4) Add explicit type annotations where inference fails (13 E0308 errors), 5) Fix closure parameter types in iterator chains and filter operations, 6) Implement proper lifetime elision rules and simplify where possible, 7) Create tests for reference cycle prevention in account hierarchies. Focus on making the borrow checker happy while maintaining performance.",
			"reasoning": "Lifetime and type system issues are among the most complex in Rust. With Account hierarchies requiring careful reference management to prevent cycles, parser generic bounds, and 20 total type-related errors, this requires deep understanding of Rust's ownership system and careful refactoring of existing designs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Fix dependency and import issues",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Resolve import and dependency issues: 1) Fix compact_str import in strings.rs - verify it's properly re-exported or use correct path, 2) Ensure parking_lot is in ledger-core/Cargo.toml dependencies if not inherited from workspace, 3) Add cfg attributes for architecture-specific SIMD code in simd_math.rs with fallback implementations, 4) Verify all workspace dependencies are correctly specified and versions are compatible. Create a simple test build matrix for different platforms.",
			"reasoning": "With only 3 E0432 errors and dependencies already specified in workspace Cargo.toml, this is primarily a configuration task. The main complexity is in the SIMD conditional compilation, but overall this is a straightforward fix requiring minimal code changes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement parser functionality",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Complete nom-based parser implementation: 1) Fix date parsing combinators with proper error handling, 2) Implement amount parsing with commodity support and precision tracking, 3) Create account name parser with hierarchy support, 4) Implement transaction parser with metadata and tags, 5) Add posting parser with balance assertions and lot pricing, 6) Implement directive parsers (account, commodity, include, etc.), 7) Add comment and metadata extraction throughout, 8) Implement error recovery and position tracking for meaningful error messages, 9) Add include file resolution with cycle detection, 10) Create comprehensive test suite covering all Ledger syntax features. Focus on zero-copy optimizations where possible.",
			"reasoning": "Parser implementation is highly complex, involving 6+ parser modules, nom combinator expertise, and support for the full Ledger syntax. The transaction_parser.rs and parser.rs files show extensive functionality needed, including error recovery, position tracking, and include file handling. This touches the core of the application's functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Complete filter and output implementations",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement filter chain and output system: 1) Create base Filter trait with composition support using trait objects, 2) Implement DateRangeFilter for begin/end date filtering, 3) Create AccountFilter with regex pattern matching and hierarchy support, 4) Implement AmountFilter for value comparisons and ranges, 5) Add StatusFilter for transaction status filtering, 6) Create output formatters for balance reports with account tree formatting, 7) Implement register output with running balances, 8) Add print formatter for transaction reconstruction. Ensure proper error propagation and consider lazy evaluation for performance.",
			"reasoning": "The filter system requires implementing chain of responsibility pattern with 5+ filter types and 3+ output formatters. Based on filters/mod.rs structure, this involves trait objects, polymorphism, and complex formatting logic. Output formatting must match C++ Ledger's format for compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Fix expression evaluation engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Complete expression evaluation system: 1) Define complete AST node types for all expression variants (arithmetic, logical, conditional), 2) Implement expression parser using nom for the expression syntax, 3) Create visitor pattern for expression evaluation with proper type coercion, 4) Implement built-in functions (amount(), balance(), date(), etc.), 5) Add variable resolution and scoping mechanism, 6) Implement query predicates for transaction filtering, 7) Add support for format strings and expression interpolation, 8) Create expression optimizer for common patterns, 9) Write comprehensive tests comparing with C++ implementation. The expr/ directory has 6 modules requiring coordination.",
			"reasoning": "The expression engine is central to Ledger's query and calculation capabilities. With 6 modules in expr/, support for multiple value types, function calls, and predicates, this is a complex subsystem requiring careful design. The existing structure shows AST nodes, parser, functions, and predicates all need implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI command dispatcher",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Complete CLI implementation: 1) Fix clap v4 derive API usage in cli.rs for argument parsing, 2) Implement balance command with account hierarchy display, 3) Create register command with customizable format, 4) Add print command for transaction output, 5) Implement accounts and payees listing commands, 6) Add session management for configuration and defaults, 7) Implement shell completion generation for bash/zsh/fish. Ensure proper error handling and user-friendly messages throughout.",
			"reasoning": "The CLI involves 5+ commands, each with multiple options and output formats. With existing structure in cli.rs, dispatch.rs, and session.rs, this requires coordinating argument parsing, command execution, and output formatting. The complexity is moderate as the framework exists but needs completion."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Create test framework infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive test framework: 1) Implement baseline_runner.rs for core functionality tests with test discovery, 2) Complete regression_runner.rs for compatibility testing with C++ test suite, 3) Enhance output_validator.rs for intelligent diff comparison ignoring whitespace variations, 4) Add test discovery from filesystem with glob patterns, 5) Implement parallel test execution with proper isolation, 6) Create detailed reporting with failure diffs and suggestions. The framework structure exists but needs completion and integration.",
			"reasoning": "The test framework has 8 existing modules in test_framework/ directory, showing significant existing structure. The main work is completing the runners and validators. With test discovery, parallel execution, and diff reporting, this is moderate complexity but well-structured."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize performance and memory usage",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Apply systematic performance optimizations: 1) Replace Vec with SmallVec for postings in transactions (typically 2-4 items), 2) Apply CompactStr for account names, payees, and commodity symbols, 3) Implement parallel transaction processing with rayon for large journals, 4) Add memory mapping with memmap2 for large file handling, 5) Implement caching with moka for expression evaluation and balance calculations, 6) Profile and optimize arithmetic hot paths in Amount/Balance operations, 7) Consider SIMD optimizations for bulk arithmetic operations, 8) Create comprehensive benchmarks comparing with C++ implementation. Focus on maintaining correctness while improving performance.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization requires careful profiling and testing across the entire codebase. With 7+ optimization crates already in dependencies and existing performance_suite.rs, this involves systematic application of optimizations while ensuring correctness. The complexity comes from balancing performance gains with code maintainability."
