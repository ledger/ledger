;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides for automatically adding transactions to a
;; ledger buffer on a periodic basis. Recurrence expressions are
;; inspired by Martin Fowler's "Recurring Events for Calendars",
;; martinfowler.com/apsupp/recurring.pdf

;; use (fset 'VARNAME (macro args)) to put the macro definition in the
;; function slot of the symbol VARNAME.  Then use VARNAME as the
;; function without have to use funcall.
