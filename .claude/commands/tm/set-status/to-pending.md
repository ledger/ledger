Set a task's status to pending.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (task ID)

## Setting Task to Pending

This moves a task back to the pending state, useful for:
- Resetting erroneously started tasks
- Deferring work that was prematurely begun
- Reorganizing sprint priorities

## Execution

```bash
task-master set-status --id=$ARGUMENTS --status=pending
```

## Validation

Before setting to pending:
- Warn if task is currently in-progress
- Check if this will block other tasks
- Suggest documenting why it's being reset
- Preserve any work already done

## Smart Actions

After setting to pending:
- Update sprint planning if needed
- Notify about freed resources
- Suggest priority reassessment
- Log the status change with context
