   * @brief Forks a child process so that Ledger may handle running a
   * pager
   *
   * In order for the pager option to work, Ledger has to run the pager
   * itself, which requires Ledger to fork a new process in order to run
   * the pager.  This function does the necessary fork.  After the fork,
   * two processes exist.  One of them is exec'd to create the pager;
   * the other is still Ledger.
   *
   * This function returns only for the process that is still Ledger.
   *
   * @param pager_path Path to the pager command.
   *
   * @return The file descriptor of the pipe to the pager.  The caller
   * is responsible for cleaning this up.
   *
   * @exception std::logic_error Some problem was encountered, such as
   * failure to create a pipe or failure to fork a child process.
