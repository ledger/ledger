 * @brief An output stream

 * A stream to output in Ledger may be going to one of three places:
 * to stdout, to a file, or to a pager. Construct an output_stream_t and
 * the stream will automatically be cleaned up upon destruction.
 *
 * This class suffers from "else-if-heimer's disease," see Marshall
 * Cline's "C++ FAQ Lite". Arguably this should be three different
 * classes, but that introduces additional unneeded complications.
